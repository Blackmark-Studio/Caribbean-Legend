# **Storm Engine License Agreement**

**(Highseas Games LLC)**

**IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:** This Storm Engine License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between Highseas Games LLC (the “Company”) and any person or entity who uses the Storm Engine or its source code (the “Licensee” or “you”). By downloading, using, or modifying the Storm Engine software (the “Engine”) or any portion of its source code made available by the Company, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, you must not use the Engine or any portion of its source code.

## **License Grant and Scope**

Highseas Games LLC hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Storm Engine, including only those portions of the Engine’s source code that the Company has released publicly (the “Licensed Code”), **solely for non-commercial purposes** and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This license **extends only to the Licensed Code** as provided by the Company and **does not grant any rights to parts of the Engine’s source code that are not publicly released**. Any portions of the Engine that have not been made publicly available by the Company remain proprietary and confidential to the Company; you have no right to access, use, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer any such non-public parts of the Engine. Except for the limited rights expressly granted here, **all rights, title, and interest in and to the Engine (including all code, binaries, assets, and documentation) are and remain the exclusive property of Highseas Games LLC**.

## **Permitted Use and Modifications**

Under this Agreement, you may use the Engine and the Licensed Code for the purpose of developing, testing, or learning from non-commercial games, mods, or other projects. You may modify or create derivative works from the Licensed Code **only to the extent that such code has been made available to you by the Company**. **You are not permitted to modify, alter, access, or derive source code from any portion of the Engine that is not included in the Licensed Code.** Furthermore, you must not attempt to circumvent any technical restrictions or security measures in the Engine or **reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Engine that the Company has not explicitly released as part of the Licensed Code**. All permitted modifications are subject to the additional requirements of Section 3 below.

## **Submission and Review of Modifications**

If you make any modifications, improvements, or additions to the Licensed Code (collectively, “Modifications”), you **must submit these Modifications to Highseas Games LLC for review** before distributing or publishing them in any form. Submission shall be made through a channel designated by the Company (for example, via the official repository or email, as instructed by the Company). You **may not release, share, or make publicly available** any Modifications unless and until you have obtained the Company’s approval or have confirmed that the Company has no objection to the proposed Modifications. Highseas Games LLC reserves the right to review your Modifications and to approve or object to their publication at its sole discretion. If the Company raises any objection to a submitted Modification, you **are prohibited from publishing, distributing, or otherwise disclosing that Modification**. Only in the event the Company explicitly approves the Modification in writing or indicates that it has no objections may you proceed to publish or share the Modification publicly. You agree to cooperate with the Company in this review process and to provide any additional information about your Modifications upon request.

## **Commercial Use Restrictions**

**This license strictly prohibits any commercial use** of the Engine, the Licensed Code, or any derivative works based on the Engine **without prior written permission** from Highseas Games LLC. Commercial use includes, but is not limited to: selling, licensing, renting, or monetizing the Engine or any part of it; using the Engine or Licensed Code within any product or service for which you charge money, derive commercial benefit, or use to advertise or promote a commercial product or service; or distributing derivative works (including games or mods) based on the Engine in exchange for any form of payment or financial compensation. If you wish to use the Engine or any derivative work thereof for commercial purposes, **you must obtain an explicit written license or authorization from Highseas Games LLC, signed by an authorized representative of the Company and bearing the official company seal**. Any commercial use of the Engine or derivative works **without such written permission is a violation of this Agreement** and is expressly forbidden. The Company reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies for unauthorized commercial use of its Engine or related content.

## **Ownership of Created Content**

**All content created using the Engine** – including but not limited to games, modifications of the Engine’s code, plugins, expansions, levels, and any other software or media developed using or incorporating the Engine or the Licensed Code (collectively, “Created Content”) – **is and shall remain the exclusive property of Highseas Games LLC**. By using the Engine and creating any Created Content, you acknowledge and agree that **all intellectual property rights and ownership interests in such Created Content are automatically assigned to and vested in Highseas Games LLC from the moment of creation**. You hereby assign to the Company any and all rights that you may otherwise have in the Created Content, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Highseas Games LLC **may, at its sole discretion, enter into a separate written agreement with you to grant you specific rights or a license to use, distribute, or commercialize certain Created Content that you have developed**. If you desire to obtain certain rights to your Created Content (for example, to commercially release a game you developed using the Engine), you must contact the Company to negotiate and execute a separate agreement. Any such agreement must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Highseas Games LLC to be valid. Until and unless a separate agreement is executed, you **have no ownership rights** in the Created Content beyond the personal, non-commercial use rights explicitly granted in this Agreement. The Company’s failure to exercise its ownership rights in any instance shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights.

## **Disclaimer of Warranties**

**THE STORM ENGINE (INCLUDING THE LICENSED CODE AND ANY ACCOMPANYING MATERIALS) IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HIGHSEAS GAMES LLC **DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED**, WITH RESPECT TO THE ENGINE, THE LICENSED CODE, AND ANY OUTPUT OR RESULTS OF USING THE ENGINE. **THIS DISCLAIMER INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT**, AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. The Company does **not guarantee that the Engine or Licensed Code will meet your requirements, operate without interruption, achieve any intended result, or be error-free**, or that any defects in the Engine will be corrected. **You assume all risks** associated with downloading, installing, using, or modifying the Engine and any Created Content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Company or elsewhere will create any warranty not expressly stated in this Agreement.

## **Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, **Highseas Games LLC and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and partners shall not be liable to you or any third party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages whatsoever** arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or your use of (or inability to use) the Engine, the Licensed Code, or any Created Content. This limitation of liability applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages. **This means the Company is not responsible for any losses or damages such as lost profits or revenue, lost data, business interruption, or any other commercial or economic loss arising from your use of the Engine or any Created Content.**

In addition, and to the extent permitted by law, **the total aggregate liability of Highseas Games LLC for any and all claims arising under or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Engine (including the Licensed Code and Created Content) shall not exceed the amount (if any) you paid to the Company for the Engine or the sum of USD $0 (zero US dollars), whichever is greater**. If applicable law does not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent disallowed, but in no event shall the Company’s liability be greater than the minimum amount permitted by law.

## **Termination**

This Agreement and the license granted herein are effective until terminated. **Any failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement will result in an immediate and automatic termination of your rights under this license**. Upon any termination of this Agreement (whether automatic due to breach or by separate notice from the Company), you must immediately cease all use of the Engine and the Licensed Code. This includes destroying or permanently deleting all copies of the Engine (including any Licensed Code and any Modifications or Created Content in your possession or control) and certifying to the Company in writing that you have done so if requested. **Termination of this Agreement will not limit any rights or remedies of the Company at law or in equity** in case of breach, nor will it relieve you of obligations incurred prior to termination. Sections of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination (including but not limited to Ownership of Created Content, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law) **shall survive** any termination or expiration of this Agreement. Termination does not entitle you to any refund, compensation, or damages of any kind.

## **General Provisions**

**Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where Highseas Games LLC is established, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in that jurisdiction. (If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that provides you with certain rights or remedies that cannot be waived, nothing in this Agreement shall affect those statutory rights.)

**Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the **entire understanding and agreement** between Highseas Games LLC and the Licensee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and **supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations, or agreements** relating to the Engine or the Licensed Code. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any promise, representation, or warranty that is not expressly stated in this Agreement.

**Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy the invalidity while retaining as much as possible of the intent of the original provision.

**No Waiver.** No failure or delay by Highseas Games LLC in exercising any right or enforcing any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. **Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Highseas Games LLC.** A waiver of one breach or default by you shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.

**Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Highseas Games LLC. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision is void. The Company may assign this Agreement freely to any successor or affiliated entity or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

**No Third-Party Beneficiaries.** This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties (Highseas Games LLC and the Licensee) and not for any other person or entity. No third party shall have any rights to enforce any term of this Agreement.

**Modifications to Agreement.** Highseas Games LLC reserves the right to modify or update the terms of this Agreement at any time upon notice to you. The Company may provide notice by posting an updated version of the license agreement with the Engine’s source code distribution or on an official website. **If you do not agree to the amended terms, you must stop using the Engine.** Continued use of the Engine after the effective date of any modifications constitutes acceptance of the amended terms.

**Contact Information.** For any questions about this Agreement or to request permissions (such as a commercial use license or rights to Created Content), you may contact Highseas Games LLC at the official contact address or email provided on the Company’s website.
