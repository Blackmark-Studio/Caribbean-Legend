He also began to study alchemy, but after some time he went into seclusion.\nPeople saw flashes of light in his house; sometimes they could also smell something strange. Then they saw him in the cemetery at nights. Once they saw him digging out a fresh corpse and bringing it to his home. And when patience ran out, local father superior contacted the Inquisition.\nWhen the guards breached the door of Merriman's house, Joachim was not there - he had escaped through a secret passage. They found a lab in the basement, and even the seasoned soldiers were shocked and sickened by what they saw. Whole rotting and dismembered bodies, human and animal skeletons, strange things... Fear and hatred for Merriman was so significant that his house was demolished in an instant.\nMerriman disappeared without a trace. The Inquisition began to search for him, sentencing him in his absence to burn at a stake as a dangerous warlock. But they never found him. And now, after all these years, I saw him again on the streets of Willemstad.";
