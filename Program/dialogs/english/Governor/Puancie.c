Colonel Doily is in Port-Royal right now, preparing his navy squadron: we are going to break our enemy's spine by striking at Curacao. But that will be later, for now we have to kill two birds with one stone, Charles.\nThe Company didn't earn all of their untold wealth with trade. The main source of the Dutch incomes in the region is the slave work in their plantations. If you're not aware, Charles: Holland is the biggest slave-owning and slave-trading nation. East-Indians carrying the 'black ivory' regularly come to Curacao from West Africa. And I happen to know something about it, unfortunately for Stuyvesant.\nRight now two Dutch East-Indians are sailing towards the Caribbean from Guinea. Their holds are full of black prisoners. In ten days or around that time the caravan will be sailing around the isle of Trinidad in the direction of Curacao. Your task is to find the caravan and capture these two East-Indiamen and their cargo. You have to destroy escorting ships, and bring the slaves to our ally, Colonel Doily, in Jamaica. This is very important Charles, that way we'll earn his trust...
