Though, I admit, this is all the Narwhals' and Rivados' fault. When Shark came here with his crew, he wanted to establish a base, but our people and the Rivados didn't like the idea. We attacked Shark's brig at night and set it on fire.\nBad idea! Shark's crew are devils, not men, all right. First, they destroyed our boats, then landed and started slaughtering us. The Narwhals retreated and the Rivados ran away as fast as they could. Finally, the pirates captured the San Augustine where the most of the island's provisions are held, then they took the Tartarus.\nShark imprisoned our leader, Alan Milrow, who also was my... my dear friend, and the Rivados' wizard Chimiset. He sent them to rot in Tartarus's cages like beasts. It's easy to swim to Tartarus from here and I managed to visit Alan a few times. There, I met Chad Kapper. Shark assigned him as a gaoler. I asked Chad to release Alan, promised him money, but he was afraid to disobey the Admiral.\nAnd then Alan was murdered in prison.\nChad told me that Shark did this, all right. So I went to Donald, who was elected leader in Alan's place, and demanded he attack the pirates immediately, but he refused, said that those sea devils were too tough for us. I told him to fuck himself.\nMy people were useless, so I made a deal with Kapper, the scum that wanted to take Shark's place. We had a plan - lure the Admiral from his fortress to some shady place and kill him. We also found a sniper with a good rifle. He could shoot the Admiral from the Fury's mast.\nNow, the interesting part is, the day before yesterday I visited Tartarus at night to tell Chad something important about our plan. I swam to the ship and overheard Chad talking with two Narwhals. Turns out that Shark didn't kill Alan. Chad did. He spread a rumour that the Admiral was responsible.\nChad murdered Alan because of me - firstly to take me for a plaything in his bed, secondly to use me to get rid of Shark.

He'll send more men, no doubt.\nI'm scared to walk out the door; the sniper we found to assassinate Shark may shoot me from Rivados territory and slip away. I won't go to Donald - he won't listen.\nAnd the Admiral? 'Please, sir, I know I helped plan your assassination, but could you see your way through to forgiving me and saving me from my former mates?'\nHe'd send me to rot in the cells of Tartarus, if he didn't put a bullet in my brain.
