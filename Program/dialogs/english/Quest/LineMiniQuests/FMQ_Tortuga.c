Just recently, Governor Levasseur has sent his loyal negro  Kampacho to go 'talk to' a local and highly respected merchant. The black beat the poor bastard to death in his own shop! This merchant had shown some sort of minor disrespect to the governor's wife during a ball or something. And this same bitch seduced me with her looks and his doubloons\nThe duplicate key exists. I used to be a decent safecracker back in France, so it was child's play. If it wasn't for the daughter of Lyons's commandant... I'd never have gone pirate. Bah! Fuck it!";
