The Mayan Empire ruled the surrunding tribes with an iron fist, with unspeakable power granted to them through infernal dealings with demons. Dark magics bought with the blood of generations of human sacrifices. \nThis Itza man knew about Tayasal, a lost Mayan city and the incredible evil still sealed within it. He told us all he knew. If those seals are opened, the consequences would be apocalyptic. From that moment on, I have done everything I could to stop this terrible evil from being awakened. I wrote to the Escorial and Rome desperately asking for aid.\nThey listened and dispatched Don Ramon de Mendoza y Riba, who established his base at Providence and started to search for Tayasal. That is when I discovered that the good Don Mendosa had...different motivations for finding the lost city. Rather than preventing the end of the world, he sought to serve Mammon rather than Christ.\nThat is why God abandoned him and sent the angel of death into his camp. All his actions were futile and led only to the pointless deaths of Spanish soldiers and faithful Indian converts.
