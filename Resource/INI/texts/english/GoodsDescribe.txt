Balls {Round shot}
Balls_descr
{
The cheapest, easiest to use, and reliable type of ammunition. Round shots are usually used to deal damage to the hull of a ship and attack coastal defensive structures at long range, but they are not very effective at damaging the enemy crew.
Base damage: hull - #f.2DamageHull#, sails-#f.2DamageRig#, crew-#f.2DamageCrew#
}


Grapes {Grapeshot}
Grapes_descr
{
A load of small lead or iron forged balls held together by a linen sack.
Has a very short effective range. Does not damage the hull much on impact, but deals devastating damage to the enemy crew. It is widely used in naval combat to soften up an enemy vessel before boarding.
Base damage: hull - #f.2DamageHull#, sails-#f.2DamageRig#, crew-#f.2DamageCrew#
}


Knippels {Chain shot}
Knippels_descr
{
A projectile consisting of two cannonballs connected by an iron chain or a rod. This ammunition is used to damage masts, spars and rig.
Generally, chain shot has low effectiveness at medium and long range as the chain tends to make the knippel tumble inaccurately. They have an unpredictable trajectory and do very little damage to the ship's hull. However, they tear through sails and rigging and can knock down masts, immobilising enemy ships.
Base damage: hull - #f.2DamageHull#, sails-#f.2DamageRig#, crew-#f.2DamageCrew#
}


Bombs {Bombs}
Bombs_descr
{
Bombs are the most expensive and destructive type of ammunition. These bombs are made of a cast iron hollow ball filled with gunpowder and equipped with a wooden fuse. After ignition, the ball explodes upon impact, hitting the crewmen with shrapnel, destroying masts, setting rigging on fire, and shattering hulls with the shockwave.
Base damage: hull - #f.2DamageHull#, sails-#f.2DamageRig#, crew-#f.2DamageCrew#
}

}


Wheat {Wheat}
Wheat_descr
{
The local varietals of wheat are highly valued for their flour, which is used by bakers to make delicious loaves of bread with an amazing crust.

}


Ebony {Ebony}

}

The silk is extremely tough, the filaments are strong, elastic and uniform in thickness. This fabric is light and breathable; it absorbs moisture quickly, but dries even faster. It retains the shape and is resistant to stretching.
With all of its advantages, silk cloth still has a significant drawback - exposure to sunlight tends to degrade the material.
}


Rum {Rum}
Rum_descr
{
A strong alcoholic beverage distilled from fermented sugarcane juice with a slightly funky taste and flavor. It's a valuable commodity, which can always be sold profitably, but also raises the morale of your sailors as long as you have some.

A shortage of rum on the ship can cause unrest among your sailors and even become the cause of a mutiny.

}


Coffee {Coffee}

Cotton {Cotton}
Cotton_descr
{
Cotton ripens late and the crop yield is rather low on the Caribbean island plantations as compared to the North American colonies, but its fibers are still very valuable, since it is unusually long and thin. These silken creamy fibers are used to make threads for the thinnest fabrics of the finest quality.
This laborious manufacture requires setting up a relatively large plantation and at least 20 slaves to work there.
}


Sandal {Ironwood}
Sandal_descr
{
Ironwood is also known as 'lignum vitae'. This dense, hard and sturdy wood is almost impossible to crack. It's very heavy and unlike most wood, sinks rather than floats in water.

}


Slaves {Slaves}
Slaves_descr
{
Men and women - white and black - sold into slavery as a result of lost battles, punishment for committed crimes, or debts. From the planter or mine owner's point of view, this is completely legitimate merchandise, since the person was already a slave at the moment of purchase. The life of a slave is usually nasty, brutal, and short - most of them die during the first seven years after being sold to work on the plantations. 
}


Powder {Gunpowder}
Powder_descr
{
Imported strategic merchandise, the product of dirty, noisy, smelly, and dangerous gunpowder mills. 'Keep your powder dry', say the experienced cannoneers. That can't be stressed enough: without gunpowder the cannons are just deadweight for a ship.
