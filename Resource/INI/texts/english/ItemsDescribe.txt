itmname_blade_05 {Cutlass}
itmdescr_blade_05 {A sailor's best friend when boarding or repelling borders. Its curved blade and wide handguard allow for both stabbing and slashing attacks, but its short reach and single edge limit its utility outside the crowded confines of shipboard combat.}
itmname_blade_06 {Schiavona}
itmdescr_blade_06 {A legendary rapier wielded by the Dalmatian Guard of the Venetian Doge. Its double-edged blade is perfect for both piercing and slashing attacks, and its guard is popularly called a 'cradle' for the safety it provides to the hand of the wielder.}
itmname_blade_07 {Ritterschwert}
itmdescr_blade_07 {A broadsword used by heavy cavalry during the last century. Its heavy blade can cleave through almost any armor. However, its weight and balance make it very impractical in foot combat.}

itmname_blade_13 {Broadsword}
itmdescr_blade_13 {This type of sword has recently become rather popular by the officers in the French Navy not only as a mark of rank but also as a reliable combat blade. The broadsword can be devastating in the hand of a strong and skilled man. Still, it's a bit heavy for duelling.}
itmname_blade_14 {Walloon Sword}
itmdescr_blade_14 {A rapier popular among soldiers in the Spanish Netherlands. It requires not as much skill as it does mobility, agility and strength. With it, one can easily slash the forearm of any devotee of elegant fencing daring to challenge you.}
itmname_blade_15 {Capodimonte}
itmdescr_blade_15 {A naval foil with a bending blade, equally well suited for both peircing and slashing attacks. A simplified guard is still enough to block most slashing strikes.}

itmname_blade_18 {Pappenheimer}
itmdescr_blade_18 {This cavalry sword with a distinctive guard was made famous during the Great Thirty Years War by the cuirassiers of Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim. Its fame made it popular among young nobles striving for making a career in the cavalry.}

itmdescr_blade_19 {A saber for a commissioned naval officer. This weapon is equally great for parade as it is for cutting tangled rigging and for landing a deadly strike from a most unexpected position.}
itmname_blade_20 {Madonna}
itmdescr_blade_20 {The saber of the feared Hungarian hussars. This blade had just recently shown up on the battlefield of Western Europe, but has already earned great respect for its balance and strength. Clearly, it has a bright future.}
itmname_blade_21 {Highland Backsword}

itmname_blade_25 {Flamberge Rapier}
itmdescr_blade_25 {This Spanish-style cup hilt rapier with a wavy blade is a very dangerous weapon - both for the opponent and for its wielder. It is reputed that even light wounds created with this blade heal very slowly. The owners of such blades often have an...unsavoury reputation.}
itmname_blade_26 {Asoleda}
itmdescr_blade_26 {A long duelling foil with a light and very narrow blade, made in Verdun. The blade makes slashing strikes impossible, but the length keeps enemies at a distance.}
itmname_blade_27 {Swept-hilt Rapier}
itmdescr_blade_27 {This rapier is named the 'Saxon Feather' for its legendary balance which allows the wielder to land slashing and piercing strikes with ease. The blade obeys with the slightest movement of the hand. Intricate guard provides decent protection for the hand.}
itmname_blade_28 {Katana}
itmdescr_blade_28
{

itmname_blade_32 {Thanatos}
itmdescr_blade_32 {An ancient arming sword from the days of the Third Crusade. This sword doesn't belong in a museum. Somehow after nearly 400 years, the edge is still razor sharp.}

itmdescr_blade_33 {An old knight's two-handed sword.}
itmname_topor_01 {Macuahuitl}

itmdescr_topor_03 {A simple but menacing weapon of the Dutch Geuzen. Just the sight of thousands of these put their noble foes to rout at the Battle of the Golden Spurs.}
itmname_topor_04 {Horseman's Axe}

itmname_topor_05 {Tomahawk}
itmdescr_topor_05 {A narrow axe with a beak on the back, deadly in melee combat and very useful for trips into the selva. This axe is in high demand among the colonists, although initially it was created specifically for trading with the local Indians, who did not know how to work iron.}

}
itmname_knife_02 {Maria}

itmname_knife_03 {Family Dagger}
itmdescr_knife_03 {The de Monpe family weapon, also known as 'the toothpick'. A valuable piece, easily sold in times of need — after all, what's the point of family insignia?}

itmdescr_m8_barrel {The stock and barrel from a dismantled four-shot rifle.}
itmname_mushket9 {Old arquebuse}

UpgradeStageInfo_mushket9_1 {Currently it looks quite poor, but proper care and good tools can transform it.}

itmname_FirearmStockPart_3 {Barrel and powder flask}
itmdescr_FirearmStockPart_3 {This set of items will greatly speed up the loading of any long-barreled weapon, but for some reason you feel they are best used with that very arquebuse.

itmdescr_grape_mushket {A handheld mortar is an excellent aid for attacking small groups of enemies. It's more practical to use it from an ambush. Petards or grenades are used when firing.}

itmname_cirass1 {Infantry Armor}
itmdescr_cirass1 {An infantry cuirass used during fortress sieges. It provides excellent protection against steel and lead, but restricts mobility, making the wearer clumsy in close combat. It became widespread in both Europe and the Caribbean.}
itmname_cirass2 {Reiter Cuirass}

itmname_cirass10 {Ironside Breastplate}
itmdescr_cirass10 {A rather worn and incomplete set of parliamentary cavalry equipment. It still provides good protection, and the abundance of pockets and cartridge pouches makes shooting and reloading much easier.}
itmname_cirass11 {Mirror Breastplate}
itmdescr_cirass11 {Such armor is common in the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire. This piece has traveled a long road before ending up in your hands.}
