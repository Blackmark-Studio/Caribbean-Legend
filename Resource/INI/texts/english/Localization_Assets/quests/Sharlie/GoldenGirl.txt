Did you hear about that pricey courtesan from the North Colonies who is now running the house of joy in St. Pierre? They say she throws private parties from time to time - only the best of high society is allowed to attend. Best wine, gorgeous women and unlimited gambling, everything a true noble values. Getting an invitation there is worth a killing.

The say Marquise Botot herself is now a guest of St. Pierre. The most of expensive woman of New France. Sometime she throws parties for creme de la creme only. The true nest for the most gracious vices. They say one banker gambled away his very own bank there, imagine that. Alas, without an invitation even the richest are unwelcome.

St. Pierre's brothel is now being run by an elite courtesan. The place itself didn't change much, but the private parties she throws there... Folk tell stories. That it is like in good old Paris - best wine, best wenches, best company. And most peculiar guests - like Spanish admirals and pirate barons! Unbelievable, aye?

They say madam Botot disappeared and left her luxury house to her trusted manager. Imagine all the sorrow fallen upon noble youngsters!
