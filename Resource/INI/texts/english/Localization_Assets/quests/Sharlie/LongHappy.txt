{
Bernard Vensan, an old comrade and associate of Marcus Tyrex, is dead, fell while clearing the town of the remnants of mercenaries rushing through the catacombs. He did not live to victory just a few hours... ~
}

LongHappy_31
{
And that's not all - Marcus Tyrex himself went missing when his ship was boarded. Jan Swenson organized the search, and I hope that the old baron was too tough for the gun balls and waves of the sea - this will be an irreparable loss for the entire Brethren of the Coast. ~

{
The losses did not pass me by either. It is always difficult when a war takes away peaceful lives. Gino Gvineili - a good friend and a brilliant scientist accidentally fell victim to this treacherous attack. I will return to Antigua to bury him as it should.

LongHappy_33
{
The grave losses did not pass me by either. Tichingitu, my loyal comrade and officer, covered my wife and Dannielle Hawk from a bullet shot. The killer got what he deserved, but by what cost? And it's like not enough. Gino Gvineili - a good friend and a brilliant scientist accidentally fell victim to this treacherous attack. I will return to Antigua to bury them as it should.
}

LongHappy_34
{
But there is also a glimmer of hope - Tichingitu, my comrade in arms, was lost somewhere at the very beginning of the battle. I didn't even expect to see him alive, but Jan said that he was seen with the niece of the local bartender, leaving to the side of the Sabo-Matila Cove bay before the attack. I was ready to think anything - but a drunken escape with a young lady? Is that Tichingitu?! In any case, it is necessary to find them as soon as possible, until the enraged uncle picked up a heavy club.
