type_full_1
{
The map is clearly fresh and the paper hasn't yellowed yet. The markings of #sMapIslName# seem hastily drawn, but if we are to believe them, the treasure is hidden #sMaplocName#.
}
type_full_1_isl {island}
type_full_1_mein {mainland}

type_full_2
{
The map is drawn rather carelessly, and #sMapIslName# is barely discernible. Judging by the markings, the treasure is hidden #sMaplocName#, but we can only be certain by going there.
}
type_full_2_isl {island}
type_full_2_mein {mainland}

type_full_3
{
This map was not valuable to its owner - the outline of #sMapIslName# is spoiled by water stains. The location of the treasure appears to be #sMaplocName#.
}
type_full_3_isl {islands}
type_full_3_mein {mainland}

type_full_4
{
The map depicts #sMapIslName#. The place where the treasures are stored is #sMaplocName#. The author's lack of skill has been compensated by effort - whimsical animals, as if drawn by a child's hand, adorn the margins.
}
type_full_4_isl {island}
type_full_4_mein {mainland}

type_full_5
{
The map accurately reflects the outlines of #sMapIslName#. The location of the treasure is #sMaplocName#. It won't be hard to find it, as the author has left fairly precise directions. 
}

type_full_5_isl {island}
type_full_5_mein {mainland}


type_full_6
{
This map is drawn on high-quality lined paper. The outline of #sMapIslName# is easily recognizable. According to the note on the back, the treasure's location is #sMaplocName#.
}
type_full_6_isl {island}
type_full_6_mein {mainland}

type_full_7
{
This is #sMapIslName#. The map indicates the location of the hidden treasure — it's #sMaplocName#. A notorious pirate hid his treasure there.  
The authenticity of the map is suggested by the brown stains of blood, which also indicate that this piece of paper has changed hands multiple times.
}
type_full_7_isl {island}
type_full_7_mein {mainland}

type_full_8
{
This map has clearly seen many hands — the paper is burned in several places, and the outline of #sMapIslName# is crossed with signs of multiple folds. The treasure's location is #sMaplocName#. Apparently, something truly valuable lies there.
}
type_full_8_isl {islands}
type_full_8_mein {mainland}

type_full_9
{
#sMapIslName#, quite accurately depicted on this map, is surrounded by scrollwork and drawings of sea monsters. Whoever the author of the map was, he clearly knew his craft, hiding something very valuable in the treasure. All that’s left is to reach the location — #sMaplocName#.
}
type_full_9_isl {island}
type_full_9_mein {mainland}

type_full_10
{
The halves of this map do not fit together, although the handwriting, ink color, and condition of the paper clearly indicate the same author. The outlines of #sMapIslName# are blurred and stained with ink, and the treasure, it seems, is located #sMaplocName#.
}
type_full_10_isl {island}
type_full_10_mein {mainland}

type_full_11
{
This map has been carefully divided diagonally, making it impossible to discern #sMapIslName# with only one half. The notes are written in neat handwriting, making it easy to understand where the treasure lies — at #sMaplocName#. Judging by the condition of the paper, the treasures have been there for many decades.
}
type_full_11_isl {island}
type_full_11_mein {mainland}

type_full_12
{
This map, made from two pieces, looks incredibly ancient. The outlines of #sMapIslName# are outdated by several decades. The descriptions and clues are written in an old-fashioned language and are rich in Latin. It’s difficult to gauge the extent of the treasures stored #sMaplocName#.
}
type_full_12_isl {islands}
type_full_12_mein {mainland}



type_quest_0
{
    This is #sMapIslName#. The hidden treasure is marked here - it's #sMaplocName#. It is said that #sMapOwner# concealed his fortune in this spot.
    The brown blood stains on the map affirm its authenticity and hint at a bloody history of ownership.

type_part
{
    This is one piece of a larger treasure map. Alone, it doesn't reveal the treasure's location. Your only hope is to find the other piece to complete the map and unveil the mystery.
}

type_fake
{
    This map claims to show the location of a treasure. You could investigate to see if it's real, but it seems more likely to be a forgery.
    It's probably best to discard this piece of paper.
