type_part
{
    This is one piece of a larger treasure map. Alone, it doesn't reveal the treasure's location. Your only hope is to find the other piece to complete the map and unveil the mystery.
}

type_fake
{
    This map claims to show the location of a treasure. You could investigate to see if it's real, but it seems more likely to be a forgery.
    It's probably best to discard this piece of paper.
