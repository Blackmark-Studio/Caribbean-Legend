#QUEST JusticeOnSale
Side Job: Smuggler in Trouble
#TEXT 1
I've agreed to help a band of smugglers rescue their captain, who's locked up in the prison at @<cityName>. Truth be told, I'd be better off steering clear of this business, but the reward they've promised is tempting. I should speak with the commandant... or perhaps it would be wiser to turn these rogues over to the authorities?
#TEXT 2
Caught up with more pressing matters, I lost track of the captain I freed from prison and the agreement with his crew. The scoundrel must have seized his chance to slip away. So be it.
#TEXT 3
I freed the smugglers' captain and collected my reward. Money knows no scent.
#TEXT 4
I freed the smugglers' captain from prison, but those scoundrels tried to double-cross me! Very well—let them make their bargains with the devil now!
#TEXT 5
I’ve informed the town authorities about the smugglers’ plans. From here on, they can handle the matter themselves.
#TEXT 6
Some of the smugglers managed to escape. The governor will no doubt be displeased with my lack of haste.
#TEXT 7
All the smugglers have received their due. Now I must report to the governor, and the job will be finished.

#QUEST AffairOfHonor
Side Job: Matter of Honour
#TEXT 1
By chance, I encountered a most ill-mannered officer. I'll need to teach him a lesson and defend the lady's honor. We are to meet at the lighthouse in two hours.
#TEXT 2
The scoundrel has been punished, and honor restored! I must bring this good news to the young lady. Back to town at once!
#TEXT 2_1
Damn it. I missed the duel. What a fool I am.
#TEXT 3
A wretched father, a worthless son, and a lady's honor at stake... Very well, let's see how this unfolds. First, I'll pay a visit to the tavern and the brothel.
#TEXT 3_1
Excellent! Now there's only one thing left—to deal with the scoundrel.
#TEXT 4
The deed is done, and father and son can rest easy—at least until trouble stirs again. Now, it's time to claim my well-earned reward.
#TEXT 4_1
Well, I missed it—so what? It's no great loss.
#TEXT 5
Are things truly so dire if the authorities are handing out letters of marque to any rascal or drunkard? I should visit the tavern and find out who’s been terrorizing the locals.
#TEXT 6
One less scoundrel in the world. It feels good to do a righteous deed.
#TEXT 6_1
I've changed my mind—I won't fight. I'm simply not in the mood. Besides, the girl should experience the pleasures of being a corsair's concubine, rather than living as a tavern maid.
#TEXT 7
A duel! And the cause could not be more serious.
#TEXT 8
The insolent fellow got what he deserved.
#TEXT 8_1
Perhaps I lost my nerve... I can't say for certain.
#TEXT 9
A local told me of an unusual way to make money: cheat partners at cards, accuse them of dishonesty, and then challenge them to a duel—killing them to keep rumors from spreading. I should look into whether this is true.
#TEXT 10
The citizen was right. Poor Tom, like the others, fell victim to that scoundrel. But I've put an end to it.
#TEXT 10_1
Cards, cheats, duels... I’ve no time for such nonsense!
#TEXT 11
A fencing instructor afraid of a duel—who would believe it! The governor's nephew won't learn much from a teacher like that. Still, it's none of my concern. I'd best pay a visit to the merchant.
#TEXT 12
The mercenary is dead. I should report the good news to the teacher.
#TEXT 12_1
That mercenary looked like a real bruiser. I decided it was wiser not to pick a fight with him.
#TEXT 13
These days, officers aren't what they once were. Still, even now, they’d rather die in a duel than fall in the heat of battle. My task is to ensure the most worthy survive. I have no more than two days. Best begin by searching for the mistress.
#TEXT 14
It appears the officer I knew was fortunate, unlike the one I didn't know—he's dead now. I should take the seconds' advice and leave town for a while.
#TEXT 14_1
I decided not to meddle in other people's affairs. Let them handle their own problems.
#TEXT 15
"Divine Justice"—what a fine name for this affair! I must intervene and defend the planter's honor in a duel.
#TEXT 16
An ambush! I should have seen it coming. Now the planter has strong evidence against his neighbor. Time to collect my reward—I've certainly earned it.
#TEXT 16_1
I wonder if I can now expect discounts from the local smugglers.

#QUEST BurntShipQuest
Side Job: Ship Replacement in @<cityName>
#TEXT 1
Harbormaster @<portmanName> of @<cityName> has asked me to find an extraordinary ship with a specific characteristic: @<text>. He’s offered a generous reward for my trouble. I have six months to complete this task.
#TEXT 2
It seems that harbor master @<portmanName> managed to resolve his problems on his own. In any case, he didn't come across as a failure.
#TEXT 3
The harbor master proved cunning and handed the insurance money over to the usurer. At least I still have my ship. We'll see how this turns out.
#TEXT 4
I've received a reward of @<money> pesos for a unique ship. For that sum, I could buy two ships of the same kind. I must admit, the harbor master certainly knows his trade and how to negotiate with the insurance office.
#TEXT 5
I've decided to keep the ship for myself. @<money> pesos is far too little for such a magnificent vessel.

#QUEST GiveShipLetters
Side Job: Lost and Found
#TEXT 1
A curious find! Someone was either in a hurry or simply too absentminded—either way, he lost a complete set of ship's documents. I'm certain the owner will soon report their loss.
#TEXT 2
Well, I did a favor for some good people, and it didn't cost me any effort.
#TEXT 3
Well, there are still good people in this world. It's a relief that the owner will soon recover his loss!
#TEXT 4
Well, the world is not without good people. I was fortunate to stop by the shipyard.
#TEXT 5
The reward was small, but I hardly had to lift a finger for it.
#TEXT 6
Perhaps it's for the best. I gained little from this, but at least I no longer have to trouble myself with those documents.
#TEXT 7
It's always a fine thing when the merchant and his goods find each other so fortuitously!
#TEXT 8
It's always satisfying when your loyalty is properly rewarded!
#TEXT 9
Unicuique secundum opera eius! The documents will soon be returned to their rightful owner—and the coin is already in my pocket.
#TEXT 10
I should have delivered these documents sooner; then their owner wouldn't have needed to obtain a new set.

#QUEST ReasonToFast
Side Job: A Reason to Hurry
#TEXT 1
A charming young woman let slip that a garrison officer was in such a hurry to reach a certain cove, he abandoned his revelry altogether. Perhaps it's worth looking into?
#TEXT 2
There are plenty of windbags about. Perhaps I was just imagining things?
#TEXT 3
Perhaps I simply gave in to the girl's wounded pride. I shouldn't have imagined things that weren't there...
#TEXT 4
What rotten luck! That fellow appeared at the worst possible moment. Now it's too late to figure out what they were planning...
#TEXT 5
It turns out I was being tracked by a pirate messenger, and the patrolman was waiting for him here. But it seems I managed to pass myself off as the messenger, @<sName>.
#TEXT 6
I tracked down the corrupt patrol officer and confirmed his dealings with pirates. Although I failed to arrest him, he received the punishment he deserved.
#TEXT 7
I failed to speak with the patrol officer. Ah, to hell with him anyway!
#TEXT 8
What ill luck! The patrol officer is dead, and his secret has died with him...
#TEXT 9
A Judas in the military is looking to earn his thirty pieces of silver. I wonder what kind of favor is worth such a pile of @<sText>?
#TEXT 10
A questionable bargain indeed! Still, @<sName> wouldn't be after this map without good reason.
#TEXT 11
The @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>', carrying a cargo of @<sGoodsName>, is sailing without an escort. That's valuable information...
#TEXT 12
The governor keeps his valuables in his own boudoir? How careless of him...
#TEXT 13
Thank God, it's finally over!
#TEXT 14
A fine blade makes for a worthy reward! I should also find out if this map is worth a handful of gems.
#TEXT 15
I've acquired a pirate map. I need to find out if it's worth the money as soon as possible!
#TEXT 16
Hmph... So much for trusting in justice—it’s turned against me. Now I stand accused of attacking the patrol.
#TEXT 17
This affair is finally over, and it seems I didn't come out the loser!
#TEXT 18
The patrolman's lead was true! This grand prize will more than cover all my expenses.
#TEXT 19
How unfortunate. I failed to make any use of the information I bought for a hefty sum.
#TEXT 20
I had to hand over @<sText> just to avoid feeling the hot breath of @<sName> on my neck. Next time, I'll be more cautious when embarking on such ventures.
#TEXT 21
@<sName> won't give up @<sText> without a fight. I need to get out of here—and fast.
#TEXT 22
It seems the pirates have discovered the patrol officer's blunder. It's likely he's already met his end—his funeral, not mine. Best I make my escape while I still can. With no one left alive, there’s no one to tell @<sName> of my actions...
#TEXT 23
The pirates knew I had the map of @<sName>, and they also knew about the island where he hid his treasures. Fortunately, their greed outpaced their wits, and they failed to find the treasure before I did.
#TEXT 24
Given that the odds were against me, I had no choice but to surrender the treasure to the treasure hunters from @<sName>. Next time, I'll be more cautious before embarking on such ventures.
#TEXT 25
I managed to sink the pirate ship that was at the center of this operation with the patrol officer. The patrolman himself must be dead by now—pirates never forgive mistakes like that. Well, it seems there’s no one left to tell @<sName> about what I’ve done...
#TEXT 26
I managed to come out of this business with the patrolman unscathed. I doubt the pirates will pursue me forever—they surely have other matters to attend to.

#QUEST PiratesOnUninhabited
Side Job: Saved from @<shoreName>
#TEXT 1
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They've asked me to deliver them to any inhabited cove. I can't blame them—they're wanted men, after all...
#TEXT 2
I delivered the shipwrecked pirates to @<toShore> and even received a small reward. It wasn't much, but every bit helps.
#TEXT 3
I brought the pirates from the deserted island to @<toShore>. However, these scoundrels had the nerve to ask me for a loan. I made it clear that I don't lend money to the likes of them.
#TEXT 4
I brought the pirates from the deserted island to @<toShore> and even lent them some money. I can't imagine how I would have managed in such dire straits if I were in their place.
#TEXT 5
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They've asked me to deliver them to any inhabited cove in exchange for a treasure map. We'll see about that map... Or perhaps I should turn them over to the authorities instead. In that case, I'm certain to receive a reward.
#TEXT 6
The scoundrel tried to deceive me, but in the end, he paid the price.
#TEXT 7
The scoundrel didn't have the map on him, but he did tell me where Captain @<capName> hid his loot. I'll need to search @<toShore>.
#TEXT 8
I can't say for certain whether the treasure was hidden at @<shore> or not—I failed to find it. At least my expenses weren't too great.
#TEXT 9
The pirate was right. I found quite a treasure in @<shore>...
#TEXT 10
That pirate was no ordinary man. It seems he promised that treasure to more than just me. Still, in the end, I was the one who claimed it.
#TEXT 11
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. I can deliver them to any inhabited cove, or turn them over to the authorities.
#TEXT 12
I decided that a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush and turned the pirates over to Governor @<mayorName>. I believe it was the right choice—at least the reward is already jingling in my pocket.
#TEXT 13
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors who were put ashore by Captain @<badCapName>. They claim that captain is sailing on the @<ship> and is involved in the slave trade. We've agreed to track him down. If all goes well, I'll take whatever is in the hold, and they'll get the ship.
#TEXT 14
I boarded @<ship> and, sure enough, found the slaves in her hold. It seems having friends among pirates does pay off from time to time...
#TEXT 15
I was tasked with sinking the @<ship> and dealing with the pirates aboard. I doubt anyone will mourn their loss.
#TEXT 16
In the heat of battle, I sank @<ship>. I had to pay the pirates for her loss—I couldn't very well leave them without any means to survive, could I?

#QUEST ShipWrecked
Side Job: The Shipwrecked
#TEXT 1
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<shipTypeName> "@<ShipName>". I must deliver them to any settlement belonging to @<sNation>.
#TEXT 2
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors who were put ashore by Captain @<badCapName>. I need to deliver them to any settlement belonging to @<sNation>.
#TEXT 3
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<shipTypeName> '@<ShipName>'. I must deliver them to the nearest settlement.
#TEXT 4
At @<shoreName>, I took aboard @<count> sailors who had been put ashore by Captain @<badCapName>. I must deliver them to the nearest settlement.
#TEXT 5
At @<shoreName>, I encountered @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<shipTypeName> '@<ShipName>'. Their captain seems to have taken one too many blows to the head—he insists on being taken to Dunkirk. I have no idea what to do with them yet. For now, I've taken them aboard; I couldn't just abandon them in this desolate place.
#TEXT 6
I delivered Captain @<sName> and his crew to @<sCity>, and even received a small reward for my trouble. Not much, but every bit helps.
#TEXT 7
This mad captain insists on being taken to Dunkirk and refuses to leave my ship. His behavior has become utterly intolerable. I have no idea how to handle this situation!
#TEXT 8
That madman finally got what was coming to him. I had no choice but to finish him off. He rambled on about unimaginable treasures, yet didn't even own a spoon. What a scoundrel...
#TEXT 8_1
What sort of people have I encountered!? The circumstances may have changed, but that's no excuse for such behavior. I had to teach this rude fellow a lesson in proper manners.
#TEXT 9
At last, I managed to be rid of that shipwreck survivor—and he even slipped me a piece of a map. I must make sail before he realizes I’ve tricked him. Heh-heh... Dunki-irk... Dunki-iiirk...
#TEXT 10
At @<shoreName>, I encountered some shipwrecked sailors. I should inform the governor of the nearest @<sNation> settlement about their situation. I believe the provisions I left will last them until a rescue ship arrives.
#TEXT 11
At @<shoreName>, I encountered several sailors who had been marooned by the pirate @<sBadName>. I should inform the governor of the nearest @<sNation> settlement about their plight. I believe the provisions I left will sustain them until a rescue ship arrives.
#TEXT 12
I was too busy to return to that ill-fated cove. I can only hope those poor souls were found and rescued by another captain...
#TEXT 13
I informed the governor of @<sCity> about the sailors stranded at @<ShoreName>, but I fear I was too late. Now, all we can do is pray to the Lord that help reaches them in time...
#TEXT 14
I informed the governor of @<sCity> about the sailors stranded at @<ShoreName> and received a modest reward for my trouble. The governor was pleased to learn that the captain of the wrecked ship survived. He will organize a rescue expedition immediately.
#TEXT 15
I delivered Captain @<sName> and his crew to the nearest settlement and was rewarded most generously, though I never asked for it...
#TEXT 16
At @<shoreName>, I took Captain @<sName> and @<count> of his sailors aboard. The captain claims that the pirate @<sBadName> incited his crew to mutiny, stole his ship, and left them stranded ashore. I promised to find his ship, '@<ShipName>', and return it to him. In exchange, I will receive whatever cargo is in her hold.
#TEXT 17
As agreed, I delivered the captain and his crew to the settlement. My only reward was their gratitude, but it cost me nothing in the end.
#TEXT 18
I boarded the @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' and, as agreed, returned it to @<sName>. I kept the contents of the hold for myself. Justice has been served.
#TEXT 19
In the heat of battle, the @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' was sunk, and naturally, everything in her hold was lost as well. I feel sorry for Captain @<sName>, but what's done is done.

#QUEST JungleGirl
Side Job: Damsel in the Jungle
#TEXT 1
I promised @<sName> from the settlement of @<sCity> to bring her @<sText1> large pearls and @<sText2> small pearls for her mistress's necklace. I have only 10 days—any longer, and all my efforts may be for nothing.
#TEXT 2
In exchange for the pearls, @<sName> gave me a fine amulet. Truly, you never know when you'll lose something—or when fortune will smile upon you.
#TEXT 3
I failed to gather enough pearls for @<sName>. I feel sorry for the girl, but in the end, it's her own doing—she shouldn't have taken a position with such a capricious mistress.
#TEXT 4
@<sName> claims she knows where her father, the notorious pirate @<sPirateName>, hid his treasure. The location is @<sTreasureLoc>. We should make landfall at @<sShore>. Once we've found the treasure, I'll need to return her to the settlement of @<sCity>.
#TEXT 5
@<sName> is dead, and I have no idea where the chests are hidden. A pity—this time, luck was not on my side.
#TEXT 5_1
I've decided not to trouble myself with searching for @<sName>'s father's treasure. She can handle it on her own, if she wishes.
#TEXT 6
The treasure of @<sPirateName> was truly vast. I’ve received my share. Now I must see @<sName> safely back to the settlement of @<sCity>.
#TEXT 7
@<sName> is dead. I feel sorry for the girl—she's just come into her fortune, and now this. What a senseless death...
#TEXT 8
I brought @<sName> home along with her treasure. As a token of gratitude, she gave me a fine gift. It’s a good feeling, bringing happiness to others.
#TEXT 9
The daughter of @<sText> in @<sCity> has run away from home. She says she cannot bear to marry the usurer's son and has pleaded with me to take her to her true love, @<sLover>. What am I to do with her? I’d hate to ruin her life, but I can see her parents’ side as well...
#TEXT 10
@<sName> is dead... Such is the fate of those young souls who ignore their parents' warnings...
#TEXT 11
I turned the runaway over to the guards. Let them decide her fate...
#TEXT 12
In the settlement of @<sCity>, the girl ran away from me as well. All I can do now is hope she finds the happiness she's willing to risk everything for. Ah, youth...
#TEXT 13
I returned the runaway to her father, and I am certain it was the right thing to do. What could be worse than the grief of parents who have lost their only child? Her father rewarded me handsomely.
#TEXT 14
I delivered the girl to her beloved. From here on, they can manage on their own—I'm no nursemaid.
#TEXT 15
I've agreed to escort the young couple to @<sCity>, where the bride will meet her new groom's family. I believe this is the right course of action.
#TEXT 16
I've delivered the loving couple as promised. Now I should head to @<sText> and claim my reward from the groom's father. I wonder how pleased he'll be to see me.
#TEXT 17
I decided not to trouble the groom's parents—they surely have other concerns. Besides, my own expenses in this matter were minimal.
#TEXT 18
The groom's father thanked me and gave me a generous gift. I almost envy these two young lovers...
#TEXT 19
It seems my efforts were wasted. The groom's father proved to be a true miser. I almost pity the young couple—neither has had any luck with their parents. Folks in this godforsaken corner care for nothing but gold. Still, I'm glad I was able to help the young ones. They deserve a better life.
#TEXT 20
I've agreed to escort the girl, @<sName>, who escaped from the brothel in @<sBrothelCity>, back to her parents in @<sCity>.
#TEXT 21
I've agreed to return the grip sack to @<sName>, who fled from the brothel. I'll need to search the private room for it. The bag should contain some money, documents, a decent dress, and other personal belongings of the poor girl.
#TEXT 22
I was too busy and had to leave the girl at the tavern. Still, I hope she's clever enough to handle things on her own.
#TEXT 23
I've done all I can. Now I can only hope that @<sName> reaches her home safely.
#TEXT 24
I delivered @<sName> to the settlement of @<sCity>. I didn't take her to her parents—no doubt they have other matters to attend to.
#TEXT 25
I brought @<sName> safely home. For my efforts, I received a fine blade—and the satisfaction of knowing I did the right thing.
#TEXT 26
I brought @<sName> safely home. As a reward, I received an excellent musket—and the deep satisfaction of having done the right thing.
#TEXT 27
I brought @<sName> safely home. Her brother invited me to join a raid against the pirates, but I had to decline.

#QUEST ShipEpidemy
Event: The Epidemic
#TEXT 1
The captain of '@<sShipName>' was clearly not exaggerating about the epidemic. I'll need to limit my contact with the crew and exercise greater caution from now on.
#TEXT 2
The epidemic is waning. My appetite has returned, which means I am recovering—thank God.
#TEXT 3
There's an epidemic aboard the ship. Sailors are dying from disease. The captain of the boarded '@<sShipName>'—may he burn in hell—wasn't exaggerating. What are we to do now? May the Holy Virgin save us all.
#TEXT 4
The disease is subsiding. Praise the Most Holy Mother of God! I must be more cautious in the future...

#QUEST ChurchGenQuest1
Side Job: Manuscripts for the Priest in @<sCity>
#TEXT 1
Father @<sName> has entrusted me with a task: to retrieve valuable theosophical manuscripts he lent—by order of his superiors and for the sake of enlightenment—to the priest in @<sOwnerCity>. The priest has not returned them as promised. I have agreed to help Father @<sName> resolve this delicate matter.
#TEXT 2
Grown men, servants of God, behaving like children! No matter—the important thing is I have the manuscripts. Now to return them to @<sColony>.
#TEXT 3_1
It's remarkable how some folks justify their laziness and irresponsibility with lofty ideals. How could anyone entrust such valuable items to a stranger without any guarantees? That priest was far too careless... Now I have to hunt down @<sCapName>, captain of the "@<sShipName>", all across the archipelago.
#TEXT 3_2
This won't be an easy task—searching for a ship when I don't even know its name. I must act quickly, before that God-fearing captain disposes of those precious books. My first step is to discover the SACRED name that @<sCapName> has written on the stern of his old tub.
#TEXT 4
Why should I be the one footing the bill for someone else's religious fervor? Damn it! I hope that near the colony of @<sColony>, I'll finally catch up with that old tub "@<sShipName>" and her God-fearing captain. Once I have those papers in hand, perhaps the Lord will forgive me a sin or two for my trouble.
#TEXT 5
Out of luck again. That @<sName> is quite the character—the priest has entrusted him with an extremely valuable cargo, yet the port officials tremble at the mere mention of his name. Well, we'll see how things turn out when we finally meet in @<sColony>...
#TEXT 6
That captain is certainly an interesting character. Now it's time to meet him in person, retrieve the long-awaited books, and deliver them to their rightful owner in @<sColony>.
#TEXT 7
Today I delivered the priest of @<sColony> his precious manuscripts and received my reward, along with a warning against the mortal sin of greed.
#TEXT 7_2
Old fool @<sCapName> ran up a debt at the tavern and left his precious books and manuscripts as collateral. Always spending, never learning... I'll pay off the debt, reclaim the manuscripts, and finally deliver them to @<sColony>.
#TEXT 8
Another entry in my ledger: I have settled the debt of the old cachalot @<sName> at the tavern. The priest’s manuscripts in the colony of @<sColony> have been redeemed. Now it’s time to return his long-awaited manuscripts and present him with my expense book as well!
#TEXT 9
It seems there are still some selfless tavern keepers left in this world. I'll make haste to @<sColony> to return the theosophical manuscripts and share the tale of a tavern owner who parted with priceless books simply to honor his vow.
#TEXT 10
Oh, my... I never would have imagined that such a simple task could be so time-consuming and demanding. At least the God-fearing Captain @<sCapName> didn't give me any trouble—he handed over the precious manuscripts and told me to be on my way, which I gladly did. Now, it's time to return to @<sColony>.

#QUEST ChurchGenQuest2
Side Job: Robbery at the Church in @<sCity>
#TEXT 1
Stealing from the church! What is this world coming to? While Father @<sName> calls down curses on these blasphemers, I’d best take matters into my own hands. If the Lord doesn’t reward me, perhaps the Padre will... They can’t have gotten far.
#TEXT 2
The townsfolk say the money was stolen by local bandits, who were clever enough to disappear. Perhaps I should search their usual hunting grounds.
#TEXT 3
Indeed, God gives everyone his due—the bandits got what they deserved, and I recovered the church’s money. Now, I should return to see the Father.
#TEXT 4
Well, isn’t that something? I did the Lord a favor and looked after my own interests as well. A true blessing!
#TEXT 5
That's even more than I expected! Working for the church certainly pays off at times.
#TEXT 6
Well, I am rich—and I am cursed. No matter. With this kind of money, I care neither for God nor the Devil.
#TEXT 7
The jungle is crawling with all manner of scoundrels, but I still haven't found the ones I'm after. I'll need to return to town to gather more precise information about their whereabouts.
#TEXT 8
The thieves who stole the church property were craftier than I expected—they've already fled the settlement. I must make haste to @<sCity> on @<sIsland> before they squander all their loot on drink and women!
#TEXT 9
The smugglers were easy enough to strike a deal with. They aided the scoundrels for coin, and betrayed them just as quickly for the same. Now, it's time to set course for @<sShore>.
#TEXT 10_1
Now that's quite a tale... Could Father @<sName> truly be so treacherous? In any case, I should speak with him first—it may be that I'm suspecting an entirely innocent man...
#TEXT 10_2
Now that's quite a tale... Could Father @<sName> truly be so treacherous? Since I've dealt with all those scoundrels, only the padre himself can confirm or deny their claims now...
#TEXT 11_1
At last, I've found the scoundrels. It may not have been the Holy Grail, but still... Time to head back.
#TEXT 11_2
I hope I've done some good in this world, and that when Doomsday comes, the Almighty will remember it—I've shared my belongings with the less fortunate, hoping to show them the path of righteousness. I should also inform the Father that his church property was likely used for the same purpose...
#TEXT 11_3
Who would have thought church property could be so costly... Still, at least I received something for my money. I'll bring the chalice to the padre—perhaps it will ease his sorrow over the stolen funds.
#TEXT 11_4
Being poor is no sin... but being a liar is! And God has rewarded such virtue: the scoundrels who defied Him shall be brought low, the church’s property will be saved, and I shall receive my rightful reward!
#TEXT 12_1
I’d like to believe the priest of @<sCity> was truly repentant. I may have lost something in material terms, but the moral satisfaction more than makes up for it.
#TEXT 12_2
What a turn of events! It seems even priests are not immune to greed. Still, all's well that ends well. Father @<sName> overcame his temptation and even reimbursed my expenses.
#TEXT 12_3
What a turn of events! Even priests, it seems, are not immune to greed. Still, all's well that ends well. Father @<sName> managed to overcome his temptation, but in his excitement, he forgot to reimburse my expenses. I had to remind him.
#TEXT 12_4
In these times, when greed rules the day, even the clergy can fall prey to the Devil's temptations—let alone common folk. It may seem foolish, but I refused to take the dirty money from that scoundrel in the soutane.

The cemetery guard on @<sCity> island is terrified. He claims that for several nights now, strange noises and eerie moans—like those of a ghost—have been coming from the graveyard. I don't put much stock in such tales, but I've decided to help the poor old man and see what's really happening. At worst, I'll have to deal with some grave robbers—or make a hasty retreat if it truly is a ghost. All that's left is to wait for nightfall.
#TEXT 2
It's both amusing and a bit sad. All those noises and moans weren't the cries of a ghost after all, but simply secret meetings between a pair of young lovers. Their parents forbid them from seeing each other, so they sought out a secluded spot. Now I can set the guard's mind at ease. On my way to him, I'll need to decide what to say.
#TEXT 3
I chose not to ruin the lives of the unfortunate couple and kept their secret from the guard. Young love... I hope things turn out well for them.

Perhaps this is the first time that a brief encounter with someone who had neither work nor business for me has made me record an entry in this journal. I don't understand why this priest made such an impression on me. I don't know his name, and he sometimes talked nonsense, but he made himself memorable. We've met twice now, and it could be dismissed as coincidence. But if we meet again...
I must admit, his interest is somewhat flattering. That look in his eyes is so... appraising. As if he admires my accomplishments. And who wouldn't? Two legendary ships, two captains whose tales spread across the entire Archipelago-both fallen by my hand.
I wonder what he'll say when he learns of my future exploits? The Archipelago is vast, but my fame, it seems, is growing faster than I thought.

How sick I am of all this! Five days... and finally I'll set foot on dry land. These past two months have been a complete nightmare, and I simply cannot understand how any sane person would tie their life to the sea!
For now - the captain awaits me. I don't like him much lately. I don't like anything here anymore.

By all appearances, an interesting evening awaits me. For now, the captain has given me free rein... within the confines of the ship, ha-ha! I can return to him at any moment and end this tiresome day.

In St. John's, they whisper that the local gypsy is the last hope for Thomas Morrison's gravely ill daughter. But she stubbornly refuses to help. Does she truly feel no pity for the poor girl?

The gypsy woman informed me that she is quite willing to help the girl, but Thomas flatly refuses to let her into his home. I want to visit Thomas and find out why he's rejecting the last hope for saving the girl. His house is in the northern part of the city, by the wall, next to a luxurious mansion with columns.
#TEXT	3
The local church priest threatened Thomas Morrison with excommunication if he accepts the gypsy's help to save his gravely ill daughter. Now Thomas is torn between his fear of falling out of the church's favor and his despair over his daughter's illness. I'll try to convince the priest to turn a blind eye to this sin for the greater good - saving the girl's life!
#TEXT	4
I'll have to find workarounds. The priest is undoubtedly stubborn, and in many ways he's right. But I still cannot agree with him. If there's a chance to get the girl back on her feet, it must be taken.

I managed to convince the priest. He agreed to turn a blind eye to the gypsy's involvement in the treatment if Thomas redeems himself before God through sincere repentance and good deeds.
   Now I need to find mangarosa - the key ingredient for the gypsy's potion. This plant is distinguished by its pleasant aroma, tall stem, and distinctive jagged leaves. I can find mangarosa in a cave outside town, from some 'unsavory characters' - likely vagrants or bandits. Well, all the better. I might not have to pay them at all.

I've done everything in my power. All that remains is to hope in the gypsy's abilities. I've become so involved with saving the little girl that I've completely forgotten my own affairs. I'll visit Antigua in a month. By then, Esther should be fully recovered.

The citizens of Bas-Ter are grumbling about the shortage of alcohol in the tavern. The innkeeper keeps promising to resolve the issue, but nothing has changed so far. It seems he's in real trouble—and where there's trouble, there's a chance to earn some coin.
#TEXT 2
The innkeeper told me his supplier from Antigua lost his distillery in a pirate raid and won’t be able to deliver anything for at least two months. He’s willing to accept any batch of wine or rum, as long as the trader has a good reputation. No paperwork required this time, but in the future he’ll only deal with honest and reliable merchants. Perhaps I should try sourcing the goods through unofficial channels... If I handle this carefully, there’s profit to be made.
#TEXT 3
The smugglers have no alcohol to offer at the moment. However, there’s a dealer living near the governor’s residence who’s been quietly trading small amounts of spirits. It might be worth paying him a visit.
#TEXT 4
I tracked down the underground alcohol dealer. At first, he mistook me for an agent of the authorities, but I managed to convince him otherwise. If I help him legalize his trade, I'll be able to purchase wine and rum from him on very favorable terms in the future. For now, I should visit the innkeeper—there may be an opportunity to earn a few more doubloons from this arrangement.
#TEXT 5
I struck a deal with the innkeeper on my own terms. He’s agreed to pay 240 doubloons for 100 bottles of wine and 100 bottles of rum, both now and for future shipments. Time to legitimize Christian’s business.

The innkeeper is pleased—the tavern is flowing with rum once more. Christian is satisfied as well; he’s gained a valuable client and his business is now legitimate. Now it’s time to consider my own share of the profits from this arrangement. To Christian!
#TEXT 8
I’ve ended up as the middleman in all this—a strange feeling. Still, everyone’s pleased: the tavern is lively once more, Christian is likely counting the doubloons pouring in, and I now have a dependable rum supplier in the Caribbean. And not once did I have to draw my sword. Incredible.
#TEXT 9
Just as I was enjoying a rare moment of smooth sailing, a pirate ship attacked me right in the port. It turns out the supply troubles were no accident—they were part of a plot by that ship’s captain to seize control of the Bas-Ter tavern’s supply line. This time, he failed. He paid for his ambition with his life.

A bold attempt was made on the Port Authority Chief in Belize. The attacker managed to escape, and now he’s become the hunted. Rumor has it the official has put a price on his head. Well, the enemy seems formidable - I’ll need to think twice before going after him.
#TEXT	2
The head of the port claims he has no idea who attacked him or why. He calls the assailant a common madman - the kind that’s a dime a dozen in the Caribbean. That may not sound convincing, but I don’t care. There’s a reward of two hundred doubloons for this 'madman’s' head. That’s what truly matters. I’ll begin the search in nearby coves and grottos. That’s where the fugitive is most likely hiding from justice.
#TEXT	3
It’s done. Time to report back to the Port Chief and claim my well-earned reward. And yet, perhaps I should have listened to what the mercenary had to say. He sounded quite convincing. Then again, who wouldn’t try to bargain for their life, clinging even to the faintest hope? Most likely, it was just another trick.
#TEXT	4
The Port Chief paid me in full, even more generously than agreed. He offered a permanent fifty percent discount on docking one ship for any period. But that generosity only deepens my suspicions. What if the mercenary spoke the truth? If he really encountered pirates, why didn’t he call the guard? Why didn’t he mention it when sending me after the 'killer'? Still, it’s all speculation. What’s done is done, and perhaps only time will reveal the truth. I must move on.

The Port Chief is a true scoundrel! Smiling as he waves my comrades off to sea, then casually sells their ship routes to pirates. People like him must not go unpunished. I'll wait for nightfall and deal with him. His filthy deeds will be exposed. The notes given to me by the mercenary will remain in his house, in plain sight. Let the whole town see him for what he really is. It's ironic that he lives near the prison-by rights, he ought to be an inmate.

Judging by his panic, this shipment must have been intended for someone important—otherwise, why all the commotion?
#TEXT 2
The gin was stolen right under the barkeep's nose. Now his life hangs by a thread—the mysterious client is clearly not someone who forgives mistakes. He’s offering one hundred and fifty doubloons to anyone who can retrieve the barrel. I have a few ideas. First step: question the sailors. Perhaps one of them saw something.

This whole story sounds suspicious. But I believe I have a theory about what truly happened. It's time to speak with the waitress.

Under pressure, the waitress confessed that the entire scene was staged by someone named Jack Wales. Together with the captain of the 'Sea Beast', they orchestrated quite a performance to steal the barrel. Such effort for gin! It seems they're not just drinkers, but true connoisseurs. The thief's house is only a few steps away—right across from the tavern.

I managed to return the barrel to the tavern keeper just in time, saving him from serious trouble.

As for the waitress, she wisely vanished—the tavern keeper quickly uncovered her part in the scheme.

Julie has found herself in a difficult situation. A necklace dear to her heart has been stolen. She cannot turn to the guards—her uncle, the governor of the French part of Hispaniola, has strictly forbidden her from contacting the one who gave her the gift. She suspects her own servant may be the thief. I cannot leave her to face this misfortune alone and have resolved to help. I should begin by questioning the local merchants—the thief surely tried to sell the jewel quickly.

His wife, Lea, haunted by fear, keeps a lonely vigil at the quay, her eyes scanning the restless waters for any sign of her husband. Only his safe return can ease her suffering. But the unforgiving sea guards its secrets well, and with each passing bell, hope fades and his chances of survival grow ever slimmer.

The worry written on this poor woman’s face compelled me to offer my help. First, I’ll search the waters of Le Marin Bay—perhaps Pierre is still at sea, held up by some misfortune. If I find no sign of him there, I’ll comb the shoreline for any trace of man or ship.

Those beach-dwelling smugglers mistook me for one of the governor's hounds and tried to send me to a watery grave. Fortune, however, turned her face from them—their own blood now stains the sand instead of mine. I must investigate the sea cave they mentioned. Perhaps Pierre is the one they've been keeping chained in that damp prison.

Pierre now breathes the sweet air of freedom, and the time has come to return him to his devoted wife's embrace. Fate dealt him a cruel hand—his skiff dashed upon the reef, and once ashore, he fell into the clutches of those addled smugglers who mistook him for a governor's agent. The poor soul endured torture and starvation, pressed to reveal secrets he never possessed. One shudders to think what grim end might have awaited him had Providence not guided my steps to that accursed cave when it did.

Pierre has been safely returned to his devoted wife's care. He has promised to show his gratitude once his strength returns, and insists we share a drink at the tavern tomorrow after the sixth bell. Yet a question still gnaws at me like a rat on a ship's rope—who were those ill-fated smugglers truly waiting for on Le Marin's shores? Their talk suggested a vessel soon to make landfall. The governor's men would surely pay handsomely for advance warning of such a ship laden with contraband. Or perhaps...

The rumors aren't false; the waitress has indeed vanished. The tavern keeper is clearly concerned... whether about her disappearance or his falling profits, who knows. He's ready to pay a hundred doubloons to whoever brings her back. I've agreed to help him search. A hundred doubloons is good motivation, but what intrigues me more is Betsy herself. What kind of woman could so captivate men that they were willing to drop everything and sit for hours in the tavern just to look at her? To begin with, we should examine her house. According to the innkeeper, it's not far from the tavern, on the hill—across from the fancy house with the blue balcony.

Betsy is clearly involved in some dark affairs. The letter I found is a direct threat to her life, which means the reason for her disappearance is far more serious than simply running away.

The day before, the blacksmith received a serious order from Admiral Eugenio de la Torre... When he arrives here, he will certainly find out why his order was not fulfilled.

Letter from the Dead

In Porto Bello, rumors are circulating that the captain of the flute "Águila" gave his quartermaster a dressing-down for letting the crew go ashore. Usually, if the crew is kept on board, it’s either because they have something to talk about or the ship really doesn’t intend to stay in port for long. I should talk to the sailors; maybe there’s a way to make some money.
#TEXT	2
On the streets of Porto Bello, I happened to meet a sailor from that very flute. He was risking missing the ship due to a prolonged search for a certain Marisa Caldera. In the hold of his ship, among the junk, he came across an old letter addressed to her and decided to deliver it in hopes of a reward. Since he no longer had the time, he offered to sell this important letter for a small price, and I agreed. After all, this story might turn out to be quite profitable.
#TEXT	3
The innkeeper said that Marisa has hardly been seen in town for the past two years. After news of her husband’s death, she seemed to disappear, avoiding people’s eyes. Yet her name is still known, and some men continue to show interest in her. One might think she took up something indecent and therefore hides, but the innkeeper insists Marisa was pious and spent a lot of time in church, so she is unlikely to be involved in such things. I need to continue the search. But where should I look for her? Who could tell me more about her?
#TEXT	4
The pastor confirmed that Marisa Caldera left town long ago and only occasionally appears in it. He knows nothing more. However, her friend Dolores Monjo lives in town and might know more than he does. Her house can be found to the left of the port authority.

It seems Marisa’s situation is quite difficult, as her friend met me with great suspicion the moment she heard whom I was looking for. However, I managed to convince Dolores of my good intentions. The meeting is set for tomorrow after eleven in the evening. Dolores gives no guarantees that Marisa will come, but she promised to pass along everything we discussed.

Now all that remains is to see her safely back to town, where she can finally start a new, peaceful life.

According to one soldier, Bishop’s put a bounty on their heads, and now armed fortune-seekers are flooding into the jungle hoping to cash in. Maybe I should join the hunt myself? Then again, the odds of catching a bullet in the gut are pretty high - and not just from the runaways but also from the people chasing them.

Mary has vanished somewhere… without saying a word. I hope it’s not because of our talk yesterday… Perhaps she just went down to the hall. I should look for her there.
#TEXT 3
It’s astonishing how chance encounters can shape a person. Especially when it’s a meeting with a cutthroat whose hands are drenched in blood. The runaway slaves, before they were cornered and slaughtered, shot several guards and Bishop’s hirelings. Worse still — they raped and killed a young colonist woman, then nearly did the same to her husband. The ringleader of the fugitives was Jerry Casper.
I doubt he was in any way kin to my beloved Mary. But the story has made her wonder: who were her parents? She knows neither their names nor even where she was born.
In any case, if we are to search for their traces, lost twenty years ago, it can only be on the Justice Island. Perhaps some of its old settlers can help us…
Mary told me not to lose sight of everything else just to chase down this mystery. But I can see it in her eyes – she’s burning to uncover the truth as soon as possible.
As for me… I am bound to help her.
Yet I know too well: some secrets are best left buried. Perhaps this is one of them. After all, no one has ever told Mary anything of her parents to this day.
#TEXT 4
So here we are again on this ship graveyard… I’ve no great desire to linger this time, so we’d best get straight to it - ask around among those who lived here twenty years ago. I think we should start with Donald. Even though, as Mary says, he either couldn’t or wouldn’t answer her questions the last time she asked, who better to help us than the leader of the Narwhal clan?
I still have a bad feeling about Mary’s plan, but it’s too late to turn back now.

We didn’t get a chance to talk to Donald — he’s running drills with his clan at the outer ring. Looks like the Justice Island is in for troubled times again. I just hope Leyton Dexter has the will and strength to keep things under control. Either way, we need to get the information we came for and leave. The last thing I want is to get caught in the crossfire of people fighting over nothing.
Greenspen should return tomorrow — we can pass the time waiting in Mary’s cabin on the 'Ceres Smithy'.
#TEXT 6
Our conversation with Greenspen yielded little results. He claims to have arrived on the Island several years after Mary was born and says he never knew her parents. There’s no one left to confirm or deny his words, but I don’t see why he would lie - there’s no real gain in it.
Still, we did manage to learn a few things. First, Mary was indeed born here, on the Island. That much Donald heard from Eric Udet, an old sailor who raised her and, sadly, has since passed on. Second, Orelie Bertine played a part in Mary’s upbringing. She’s lived on the Island for many years, and if she was around when Mary was born, then she must have known her parents as well.
Donald mentioned that her health has been failing - age takes its toll. Let’s just hope her memory is still sharp.
#TEXT 14
We didn’t learn everything we wanted, but one should count his blessings. Orelie remembered quite a lot, and for that, we are grateful. So, let’s go over what we do know. The information that Mary was born on the Isle of Justice has been confirmed. But her parents weren’t locals - they were shipwreck survivors who somehow made it through a brutal storm.
Mary’s mother was named Theresa. She gave birth about a week after arriving on the island and died shortly thereafter, which is hardly surprising, considering all she had endured. Why she was aboard a ship (whether naval or merchant) in the final month of her pregnancy is a question only her husband (Mary’s father) might answer.
But that’s where things get much more complicated. Orelie could only remember that his name started with “J.” Nothing else - neither the name of the ship nor its type.
Bertine claims that this mysterious “J.” vanished just a few days after his daughter’s birth. She doubts that the man died, though - back then, smuggler tartanes made regular runs between the Island and Cuba. And there’s no evidence that he perished in the ship graveyard.

It’s hard to say whether Mary’s father is still alive, or why he would abandon his newborn daughter if he survived. Then again, maybe it’ll be enough for Mary just to learn who he was...
But to move forward with this difficult matter, we need at least the name of the ship that was wrecked on one of the June nights of 1638, out near the outer ring. And for that, we’ll have to turn to none other than Donald Greenspen. 
#TEXT 15
My suspicions were confirmed: the Narwhals do indeed keep records of ships driven upon the outer ring of the Justice Island, the valuables taken from them, and their passengers. It’s a kind of tradition each new head of the Narwhal clan follows, Greenspen included. Yet Donald could not hand those records to us — Leighton Dexter took them from him not long ago.
#TEXT 16
I can’t shake the feeling that, throughout this so-called investigation, our bad luck has been unnaturally persistent. One setback after another. Nobody knows a damn thing, and the few who might help us are either dying or already dead. As for the ship records, Leighton Dexter didn’t have anything from the year we need - 1638. They’ve vanished from Ailan Milroe’s cabin. And yet Mary insists that the former head of the Narwhal clan held such documents in the highest regard, and would never have destroyed them. But then, who else on this floating graveyard of ships would have any interest in papers that only a historian might care about?

At last a way out of this cave of ignorance and riddles. Mary’s mother and her father — Joshua Casper — reached Justice Island aboard the English Navy brig 'Wrangler'. Two other seamen survived with them but gave up their souls the next night. My inner voice says it wasn’t an accident, though after twenty years proof is gone. Still, we learned what we needed from those who saw those days, and now we can leave Justice Island to leeward.
What remains is to consider who might help us uncover more about Joshua Casper. There’s no way we can access the Royal Navy’s archives on our own...
But before we set sail, I want to make sure nothing has slipped through the cracks. Who else might know something? Who’s been on this island long enough to remember the events of those days? 
#TEXT 18
To think that I almost forgot about Chimiset - he’s probably the oldest resident of the Island of Justice. He arrived here back in 1623 and witnessed Mary’s birth, her mother’s death, and her father’s disappearance. Joshua Kasper was locked up after killing two Narvals who refused to let the shaman near the birthing mother.
From Chimiset’s story, it’s clear that Joshua managed to escape and sneak onto one of the smugglers’ barges. There’s no other way off the island. He left his newborn daughter behind and surely planned to come back for her later. But if he shared those plans with anyone, we’ll never know because those people have long since become crab food. The only lead might be Padre Domingo, the former priest who also passed away but had spoken with Kasper on the Tartarus. Maybe he kept some sort of diary with traces of that conversation. We can find out from Brother Julian whether that’s true.
P.S. There’s one more curious detail. Before she died, Teresa Kasper shouted the name Rupert, not Joshua, her husband and the father of her child, who did everything he could to save her, but Rupert. That’s what Chimiset says, and I have no reasons to doubt him. 
#TEXT 19
Our visit to Brother Julian was not in vain. From padre Domingo De la Cruz’s notes they found Mary’s birth date — 22 June 1638. She was christened on May 3, together with Fabian Galard, son of Cecil Galard, who soon after died. It was Cecille who nursed Mary, and now she remains our last hope of uncovering the details of the conversation between Padre Domingo and Joshua Casper before the latter’s disappearance. 
#TEXT 20
The more we learn about Mary’s parents, the deeper we sink into a quagmire of mysteries and confusion about what really happened on the Island of Justice twenty years ago. It’s very curious who Rupert was to Teresa… a brother, a friend, or perhaps… her husband?
The conversation with Cecille Halard gave me a thought that Joshua Casper might not have been entirely honest. For some reason he may have used a different name, either someone else’s or completely made up.
But that’s just a thought, nothing more. If we are to initiate a search in the naval archives, it should be strictly under the name Joshua Casper. Everything else is mere speculation for now. 
We must go to Abbot Benoît in Saint-Pierre.
#TEXT 22
Abbot Benoît is clearly not as simple as he appears. I saw a spark of excitement in his eyes the very moment I asked him to procure information from the Admiralty archives, information that might well be a military secret. Or perhaps I imagined it? But if the abbot’s past holds dark secrets, he is unlikely to share them with me. As for Mr. Casper’s past — God willing, we will learn something of it in two months, the time it will take to obtain the needed records.
#TEXT 23
And how simple this story seemed at first! So, what do we have... Joshua Casper was an officer with a spotless reputation, captain of the brig Cornwell, who, following orders, sailed from England to the Caribbean with pay for the garrisons of Antigua and Providence, which at that time still belonged to the English. Near the Azores, there was a battle with a Spanish galleon, in which a third of the crew and one officer (Rupert Northwood) were killed. This is what the official report preserved in the Saint John’s port authority states. After leaving Antigua, the Cornwell set course for Providence, but ended its journey on the reefs of the Justice Island, already under the name Ranger.
Four people survived the shipwreck - the captain, a woman, and two sailors. The latter died within less than a day. Were they murdered? Almost certainly, since they might have known too much. It was either the real Joshua Casper, madly in love with his first mate’s wife, given that he desperately searched through the wreckage to find someone who could save Teresa or Rupert Northwood, whose name Teresa shouted before dying, mysteriously calling himself by his captain’s name. The second option defies any logic. Just as the fact that this man never returned to Justice Island for his daughter-not after a month, not after a year, not even after twenty years.
Perhaps he really did die… sometimes experience, courage, and cunning don’t save you from fate. But just as he went too far then, we are now neck-deep in the tangled web of this mystery. And we certainly have no intention of turning back or stopping.
It’s worth disturbing Orélie Bertine once again, and then deciding who exactly we are looking for: Rupert Northwood or Joshua Casper. 
#TEXT 27
We succeeded after all. What befell the 'Cornwall' and how it became the 'Wrangler' we could not yet uncover — but it struck the reefs of Justice Island under Rupert Northwood’s command. Whether he still lives after two decades, I cannot say — nor where to find him if so. To aid us in this task, we must call upon an old acquaintance, one with the connections and resources such a search demands. And while we make our way to him, I must ponder whom we should truly send his men to seek: Joshua Casper or Rupert Northwood? Then again… he is clever enough not to repeat names. Of course, a fugitive is safer using his true name, lest he betray himself by failing to answer to another. But was the 'Cornwall'’s first mate really such a simple man?

We’ll have to delay our departure from the Justice Island. Orelie Bertine passed away last night. The old woman died in her sleep, with a smile on her lips. We were lucky to have sailed here at full speed - had we arrived even a day later, who would we have spoken to about Mary’s father?
And yet, I can’t shake the strange feeling that Orelie... was waiting for us.
The thought won’t leave me alone, and while Mary helps the islanders with the funeral preparations, I’ll pay a visit to Chimiset - I need to talk to him about this. 
#TEXT 29
Everything has its price. I always knew that and tried to keep it in mind when making decisions. If I had known back then what Chimiset was condemning Orélie to, would I have taken her to him that night? It’s hard to admit, even to myself, but I probably would have - because without the knowledge lost in Orelie’s illness-warped memory, we wouldn’t have made any progress in finding Mary’s father.
Is it cruel? Definitely. Is it cynical? Without a doubt. Since my conversation with Chimiset, I’ve spent many hours thinking about what he calls the river of time. Truly, it can’t be turned back. If only because it wouldn’t make sense-we usually reach certain decisions consciously at the critical turns in that river, and those choices are what make us who we are.
Orelie Bertine, rest in peace. We will finish the task for which you gave your life, even without knowing it.

Fadey, as expected, asked for a fair sum, though less than he might have, given his love of gold. We must return to him in a month — by then, something regarding Mary’s father should be clear.

We’re almost there. The only thing between us and our goal is the distance from Base-Terre to Belize. That’s where the man named Jerome Souvernier is, and he claims to have found Rupert Casper. We set all sails and head west. Mary’s twenty years of waiting to see her father are nearly over. 
#TEXT 33
So, we are in Belize. I think finding Jerome Souvernier will not be difficult. I am sure the tavernkeeper knows where he lodges. Still, I am troubled by that brawl in the 'Glass Eye' involving Jerome. He was on an important, well-paid mission — so why throw himself into it? Perhaps it ties somehow to his search for Rupert Casper. Best not to draw too much attention, and to think carefully before asking questions in the tavern.
#TEXT 35
We walked a long and winding road — only to reach a bitter truth: be careful what you wish for. That is the lesson this tale has taught us. Poor Mary, she surely deserves a better father than Rupert Northwood… but one cannot choose one’s parents. Be the outcome monstrous, the disappointment gnawing — life goes on. We spent the whole night on the shore, breaking the silence only now and then with words of what had happened. Mary bore the blow with strength. She will not torment herself with thoughts of who her father was and what 'deeds' he did. And I… I will do all I can to see that she thinks of it as little as possible.

They say a man from that very shipwreck that now rests on the shore of Sabu-Matilla Bay is wandering around Sharptown. He claims to be the sole survivor of the wreck. Now he wants to go back there, but doesn’t dare go alone — and to justify it, he spins tales about an Indian skeleton. Well, we’ll see… Maybe it’s worth escorting him. I wonder what he’s looking for after all this time.
#TEXT	2
I agreed to help the old man, Gonsalo Peralta. He doesn’t seem insane, aside from his strange stories. Well, I suppose this won’t take long — the bay isn’t far.
#TEXT	3
When I agreed to escort the old man, I never imagined I’d be fighting skeletons. Skeletons! Fortunately, luck was on our side, and despite the shock, we managed to fend them off. In the captain’s cabin, we found the bishop’s chest, filled with jewels and an old journal belonging to Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar — the famous conquistador and first governor of Cuba. Even a quick glance through those memoirs sent chills down my spine. Perhaps in this log lies the key to unraveling the curse that haunts Gonsalo.
#TEXT	4
The journal is dealt with. I brought Gonsalo back to where I found him — Sharptown. Well, I’ll him live in peace, if the nightmares have truly left him. As for me, I’d best keep my mouth shut — stories like this have a way of turning on the storyteller.
