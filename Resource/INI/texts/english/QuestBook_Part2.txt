Captain @<sCapName> is dead, and it seems the poor woman has perished as well. The mission has failed.

I've found Captain @<sCapName>. The kidnapped woman is being held in his cabin. Now I must board the ship. I doubt I'll be able to resolve this matter peacefully with that pirate...

I've agreed to help a citizen of @<sCity> named @<sName>. My task is to find his countryman, a merchant named @<sCapName>, who sails aboard the @<sShipTypeName> "@<sShipName>".
I suppose I'll find him easily enough.
#TEXT 2
The harbor master of @<sCity> told me that Captain @<sCapName> set sail for @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal> on @<sDate>.

Word is that Captain @<sCapName> is sailing from @<sCity> to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal>.

I found the captain and informed him that his comrade was searching for him. My task is complete. Time to return to @<sCity> and collect my payment.

I've agreed to carry out a rather unusual request from a woman named @<sName>, a resident of @<sCity>. My task is to find Captain @<sCapName>, who commands the @<sShipTypeName> "@<sShipName}."
I must find him, board his vessel, and eliminate the man. But before I do, I must let him know who has placed a price on his head.
Well, only a scorned woman seeks revenge with such determination...

The harbor master of @<sCity> told me that Captain @<sCapName> set sail for @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal> on @<sDate>.
#TEXT 3
They say that Captain @<sCapName> is sailing from @<sCity> to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal>.

Captain @<sCapName> is dead. I've fulfilled my employer's request.
Fury's mission is complete. Now I can return to @<sCity> to claim my reward.

#QUEST Slavetrader
Slave Trader
#TEXT 1
A usurer in @<sCity> named @<sName> has offered me @<sSum> for @<sQty> slaves. The money is good, and the job seems simple enough. I won't waste any time—@<sName> appears to be involved in serious business, and there could be a hefty profit in it for me.
#TEXT 2
The slaves have been delivered and payment received. Additionally, @<sName> has offered me another mission in three weeks. I should accept it.
#TEXT 3
@<sName> has ordered me to disrupt his competitor's deal. I must capture the '@<sShipName>', which is bound for @<sShoreName> at @<sShoreType>. I have two weeks.
#TEXT 3_1
I arrived just in time! The captain of '@<sShipName>' is loading slaves onto a smuggler's vessel. I must board both ships and seize their cargo.
#TEXT 4
The job is done. Time to report to my employer.
#TEXT 5
My opponents proved too formidable, and I was forced to retreat. I must admit, this is a failure.
#TEXT 5_5
I failed the mission, so @<sName> won't do business with me again. What a shame...
#TEXT 6
@<sName> was pleased with my work. He paid me @<sMoney> pesos for @<sQty> slaves. I should return to see him in a month.
#TEXT 7
I was too late, and '@<sShipName>' had already departed. I must return empty-handed.
#TEXT 7_1
I was too late—the pinnace '@<sShipName>' had already set sail. I have no idea where to find her. I'll have to return empty-handed.
#TEXT 7_2
Despite all my efforts, I wasn't able to find '@<sShipName>'. I must return empty-handed.
#TEXT 8
I refused the job. I'm no bounty hunter.
#TEXT 9
I was a fool to trust this scum! Now I have to deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT 10
@<sName> has given me a risky task this time. I need to board the pinnace @<sShipName>, which is sailing nearby. I must be cautious and avoid getting hit by the fort's guns.
#TEXT 11
The enemy was too strong. I failed to board '@<sShipName>'. I suppose I shouldn't even speak to my employer...
#TEXT 12
The pinnace '@<sShipName>' lies at the bottom of the sea. There's no need to visit my employer now.
#TEXT 13
Damn it! The pinnace '@<sShipName>' was a trap—there weren't any slaves aboard, only armed soldiers. I ought to put some burning fuses between my employer's toes...
#TEXT 14
It seems @<sName> was truly betrayed—the pinnace captain’s last words confirm it. The evidence is now aboard the brigantine '@<sShipName>', bound for @<sIsland> to reach the governor-general. I must intercept the ship and seize the package containing the documents, or I’ll find myself in serious trouble.
#TEXT 15
Damn it! I failed to capture the brigantine '@<sShipName>'. Well, it's time to visit the lawyer.
#TEXT 16
I managed to chase down and capture '@<sShipName>'. I also found the papers I needed. Now I can breathe easy.
#TEXT 17
I managed to chase down and capture '@<sShipName>', but there were no papers aboard. Perhaps they were forged? I need to speak with the usurer.
#TEXT 18
I need to find and capture the heavy galleon '@<sShipName>', which is sailing from @<sAreal> to Santiago. I must stay alert—there are three thousand slaves aboard, a true fortune!
#TEXT 19
That was unexpected. It wasn't a galleon—it was a damn battleship with a deadly skilled captain, yet I still managed to defeat him.
#TEXT 20
@<sName> asked me to wait five days while he gathers the funds to pay me, and gave me fifteen credit chests in advance. I find it hard to trust this scoundrel, yet I doubt he will try to cheat me.
#TEXT 21
@<sName> has asked me to track down and eliminate the traitor responsible for our troubles. His name is Francois Gontier, and he was last seen in Panama. I'll see to it personally.
#TEXT 21_1
The bartender in Panama told me that Gontier has likely gone to Porto Bello.
#TEXT 21_2
Gontier bought a corvette there. I need to find out where he went.
#TEXT 21_3
According to my information, Gontier has sailed to Jamaica. His corvette is named "@<sShip>".
#TEXT 21_4
Gontier was staying in Maroon Town, renting a room, but now he's disappeared. I have no idea where to look for him.
#TEXT 21_5
A waitress told me she knows where Gontier went, but she wants a jeweled pendant in exchange for the information. I need to find this pendant if I want to track down Gontier.
#TEXT 21_6
Gontier has gone to Havana. Splendid. I suppose I'll be seeing him soon.
#TEXT 21_7
Interesting! Gontier tried to obtain a Spanish privateer license but failed. The barman said he chose France instead. Time to set sail for Tortuga!
#TEXT 21_8
Something is very wrong! There's no sign of the corvette, yet Gontier and his men are roaming the streets. I must search the town and its outskirts.
#TEXT 21_9
The rat was hiding in one of the houses. As soon as I entered the room, his accomplices attacked me. I had to kill them, though I doubt anyone will mourn their passing. Gontier escaped. His lover told me that his corvette is anchored near the lighthouse at Tortuga. I must sail there before he slips away again!
#TEXT 21_10
I was too slow, and Gontier managed to escape. There are no clues left. I should return to my employer and report the mission's failure.
#TEXT 21_11
Gontier proved too formidable for me, so I chose to retreat. I should return to my employer and report the mission's failure.
#TEXT 21_12
It's done! That scoundrel Gontier is shark bait now.
#TEXT 21_13
For eliminating the traitor, I was rewarded with an excellent spyglass. The usurer also paid me 100,000 pesos, plus 50,000 as compensation for my expenses. It seems my employer is back on his feet. I must return in a month with a well-prepared squadron. The next mission will be a serious one.
#TEXT 21_14
@<sName> was displeased, but he invited me to return in a month with a well-prepared squadron. The next mission will be a serious one.
#TEXT 22
I was right. The barque was wrecked, and all the slaves took refuge at the lighthouse. Tamango and his warriors attacked us, but we fought them off. The remaining runaways accepted their fate and surrendered. In total, I captured @<sQty> slaves.
#TEXT 22_1
@<sName> ordered me to sail to Curacao, which has suffered from a major slave escape. I need to find out more about this incident.
#TEXT 22_2
I had an interesting talk with the barman. Now I know all the details about the riot. I also learned that someone has stolen a barque, and the barman is certain the slaves are responsible.
#TEXT 22_3
The harbor master gave me only the name of the barque—'@<sShipName>'. Unfortunately, that's all I have to go on. I have no idea where to begin my search...
#TEXT 22_4
Surprisingly, I learned what I needed from a drunken sailor. The barque was spotted at @<sAreal>. According to his story, the ship was wrecked. I should head there and search all the nearby bays.
#TEXT 22_5
@<sName> was pleased. He paid me 330,000 pesos for the Curacao slaves and @<sMoney> for the rest. I should meet with him again in a month, as usual.
#TEXT 22_6
@<sName> was pleased. He paid me @<sMoney> for @<sQty> slaves. I should meet with him again in a month, as usual.
#TEXT 24
Damn, I never thought @<sName> was that serious! Now I have to capture the fort at Havana. According to the information I received, there are 5,000 slaves there. I'm on my way.
#TEXT 25
The usurer was right. Two battleships are patrolling near Havana's shores, and they don't look friendly. I must deal with them before I assault the fort.
#TEXT 26
The enemy battleships have been destroyed. Now it's time to capture the fort.
#TEXT 26_1
The enemy battleships have been destroyed, but I'm out of resources to assault Havana. I must retreat. I suppose there's no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT 27
Havana has fallen. The job is done. @<sQty> slaves have been loaded into the cargo holds. Time to set sail for home.
#TEXT 27_1
I failed the mission by attacking Havana from the land side. The slaves were kept inside the fort, and the defenders had time to prepare. I suppose there's no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT 28
I was too late—all the slaves have already been sent to the plantations in Cuba. I suppose there's no reason to return to my employer...
#TEXT 29
Damn it! Not all the slaves survived the voyage, and the usurer demands 5,000—not a single slave less! I must find the rest within a week, or I'll be in serious trouble.
#TEXT 30
I failed to deliver the slaves on time. There's no longer any need to rush—I must sell the slaves, visit the agents, and deal with the bounty hunters...
#TEXT 31
I failed to gather 5,000 slaves in time. Now I must deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT 32
The slaves have been delivered to my employer. I should visit him in a week to collect my payment—over a million for this job! This is exactly why I do this work. I can't even imagine what the next mission will bring. Yes, this business will make me rich!
#TEXT 33
The bastard double-crossed me! When I came to collect my coins, I found that my so-called 'partner' had vanished, taking both my million and his investor's money. I've never been swindled so thoroughly before! But he'll get what's coming to him. They always do. The world is small, and our paths may cross again. That rat will pay for everything!

#TEXT 2
The cannons have been delivered, and I've received payment—not in coins, but in chests of credit. That suits me just fine, and I imagine the commandant feels the same.
#TEXT 3
What a pity! The commandant refused to buy the cannons. Now what am I supposed to do with this load of iron? I suppose I'll have to sell them to the shipyard for a few coins...

I spent too much time searching for cannons, and @<sName> bought them from another seller. My fault...

Time has run out for the delivery. I must hurry, or my client will begin to suspect something is amiss...
#TEXT 3_1
I was too late. There's no need to hurry anymore...

I was late by @<sDay>, so my payment was reduced to @<sMoney>.
#TEXT 5
All agreements are now void. If I wish to deal with them again, I should visit the client and try to resolve the situation.
#TEXT 6
I had to pay a fine—@<sMoney>. Still, I can look for work again. I'd best consult my trade journal now to find the best price for my cargo...

These bureaucrats are damnably insolent! They tried to strip me down to my very last stitch. I'd sooner embrace the enemy than pay such a sum to those grafters.

I'm running out of time, and the mail is still undelivered. I must hurry...

I failed to deliver the mail on time in @<sDay>. My payment was reduced by 10% for each day of delay, so I received a total of @<sMoney>. I must do better next time.

I delivered the package. Though I didn't receive any coin, at least my reputation remains untarnished.
#TEXT 10
The job is done, the mail has been delivered, and I've received my payment.
#TEXT 11
That was unfortunate—I was forced to hand over the package to some scoundrels. I must meet with my client and tell him the truth...
#TEXT 12
As soon as I left the harbor master's office, I was stopped by two masked men. They looked like serious, professional mercenaries—or so I suppose. I decided it was wiser to abandon my mission than risk my life. I should speak with the harbor master and explain the situation.
#TEXT 13
As soon as I left the harbor master's office, a man approached me and invited me to follow him to a tavern to discuss the package. I refused—something about it didn't sit right.
#TEXT 14
A frigate attacked me right at the port. It appears to be the ship of that damned agent who tried to "deal" with me.
#TEXT 15
I had a good opportunity to earn some coin—I let the man copy those documents for @<sMoney>. Not bad...
#TEXT 16
The agent tried to bribe me, but failed. I am no Judas!
#TEXT 17
Well... My client noticed that the package had been opened. It seems the agent wasn't very professional. I didn't receive any coin for the delivery, and my reputation has suffered...

#TEXT 8
I had to pay a fine—@<sMoney>. Still, I can look for work again. I'd better check my trade journal now to find the best price for my cargo...
#TEXT 9
These bureaucrats are far too insolent! They tried to rob me down to my very clothes. I'd sooner side with the enemy than pay such a sum to those grafters.
#TEXT 10
I failed to protect the ships. The mission is lost.

Unfortunately, one of my ships was sunk during battle with the enemy. I managed to save the other, though I received no reward. I should study tactics further to avoid such mistakes in the future...

The voyage was a disaster—one of my ships was sunk in battle with the enemy, and I lost a considerable amount of cargo.

Though I lost all the ships I was escorting, I still received payment for the cargo delivered—only half the coins: @<sMoney>. It'll have to do, especially after such a dreadful voyage...
#TEXT 18
I've lost the ships I was meant to protect, and my payment has been cut in half. On top of that, I was fined 10% for each day of delay. In the end, my reward is @<sMoney>. It'll have to do, especially after such a miserable voyage...

I need to rendezvous with a vessel carrying weapons at @<sTargetColony> and escort it safely to @<sStartCity>. My reward will be @<sMoney>. I must set sail at once—there's little time, only @<sDay>.

I've wasted too much time dealing with my own troubles. There's no need to sail to @<sIsland> now—the mission has failed.
#TEXT 27
I found '@<sSName>' near the island. She's barely afloat—her mast is gone and most of her crew are lost. She can't sail without major repairs. I'll need to purchase supplies in the nearest colony and bring them back here. The list: planks—@<sQty1>, sailcloth—@<sQty2>, and cotton—@<sQty3>.
#TEXT 28
I wasted too much time, and the captain of '@<sSName>' has already sailed away on his damaged vessel. The mission has failed.

Repairs are finished. We can set sail for @<sStartCity>.

I have escorted '@<sSName>' to @<sStartCity>. The captain covered my expenses and presented me with an Indian amulet as thanks for my help.
#TEXT 32
I reported to the harbor master and received @<sMoney> pesos.

I found '@<sSName>' near the island, where she was locked in battle with pirates. I joined the fray, and despite the raging storm, we overcame our foes. Now I should speak with the captain.
#TEXT 33_1
I decided not to waste any more time talking with the captain of the lost ship. I saved them from the pirates—that's enough.
#TEXT 34
I found '@<sSName>' near the island, locked in battle with pirates. I joined the fight, but a storm sank the lost ship before I could save her. I did all I could, and at least now I know the truth of what happened. I should return to @<sStartCity> and report this unfortunate event.
#TEXT 35
I managed to find '@<sSName>' near the island. She was engaged in battle with pirates, and I joined the fight. A storm struck, and the enemy proved too strong, forcing me to retreat. I won't report this; it's my shame to bear.
#TEXT 36
@<sSName> is in my squadron. Time to set sail for home.
#TEXT 37
I have escorted '@<sSName>' to @<sStartCity>. The captain and his crew rewarded me with @<sMoney> and an Indian amulet for my assistance.
#TEXT 38
I didn't find '@<sSName>' near the shores of @<sIsland>, but I did locate her captain and crew at a bay called @<sShore>. I took them aboard at once; those Indians made their intentions quite clear.
#TEXT 39
As soon as we reached open waters, we were attacked by a pirate corvette—most likely the very ship the captain warned me about. I have destroyed the pirates.
#TEXT 40
I've arrived in @<sStartCity>. The former captain rewarded me with @<sMoney> and an amulet for my assistance. His crew will remain under my command.

The harbor master of @<sStartCity> asked me to intervene in a nearby battle—pirates are attacking merchant ships. I agreed to help. I must eliminate the pirates and prevent them from sinking the merchant vessels.
#TEXT 42
I've wasted too much time ashore—the battle ended without me. The mission has failed.

The battle was a success—all pirate ships have been destroyed, and we suffered no casualties. I can now return and claim my reward.

The battle went well enough, but we lost one of our trade ships. I should report this.

The battle did not go in our favor; all the pirates were defeated, but only one merchant ship survived. I should report this.

A merchant in @<sCity> is in trouble—he can't leave his shop for even a moment. I need to deliver his letter to the commandant before the day is out. Payment is 300 pesos.
#TEXT 2
It seems someone is trying to ruin the merchant's business by selling goods illegally at low prices. I've agreed to help. I should start by investigating the local smugglers—they must be involved in this somehow...
#TEXT 3
My conversation with the smugglers was pointless—my mistake, I suppose. There are no clues left; it seems the merchant will have to handle this himself.
#TEXT 4
I was too slow. The mission has failed.
#TEXT 5
I managed to deceive the smugglers—they've arranged a meeting with me. I need to go to the local harbor master's office at night; they'll meet me there and lead me to their illegal shop. I can either inform the commandant and let him handle them, or take care of it myself...
#TEXT 6
I missed the meeting. The mission has failed.
#TEXT 7
I decided to give all the information to the commandant. He assured me that the scoundrels will be arrested tonight. I should visit the merchant in a few days to collect my reward.

I was led to the lair, where I confronted my rival. I managed to frighten him—he fled and paid me handsomely. Now I can return to the merchant and claim my reward.
#TEXT 9
I was led to the lair where I met my rival. Negotiations broke down and ended in a fight. I killed two of his men, and he begged for his life. I let him go and confiscated all his belongings and coins. I doubt he'll risk trading in this town again. Now I can return to the merchant and claim my reward.
#TEXT 10
I was led to the lair where I confronted my rival. Negotiations quickly turned violent. I killed the man and two of his accomplices. Perhaps it's for the best—he won't trouble anyone again. Now I can return to the merchant and claim my reward.

Bottleneck Commodity

Soldier @<sName> asked me to buy him a batch of good French wine—anywhere from ten to sixty bottles. I agreed to his request; there may be a decent profit in it for me.
#TEXT 1_1
I've secured the wine. During our conversation, the soldier mentioned he would be waiting for me atop the fort tomorrow.
#TEXT 2
A week has passed, and my soldier friend has likely set sail, just as he said he would. There's no need to concern myself with his request any longer...
#TEXT 3
I paid 1,000 coins, and now I know who sells wine in large quantities. It's @<sName>, the owner of the local shop. I should pay him a visit.
#TEXT 4
These merchants are far too greedy. They won't say a single word without payment, and I refuse to pay these scoundrels.
#TEXT 5
Surprise. @<sName> doesn't trade in wine. It seems that scoundrel has lied to me. I need to have a word with him.

The shipyard master in @<sCity> has asked me to find a @<sShip> and deliver it to him. The ship's condition and characteristics don't matter—only the type is important. I have two months to complete the task. My reward will be one and a half times the value of the ship.

A mysterious thief has stolen a valuable tool from the shipyard master of @<sCity>. The item in question is @<sName>. I should ask the locals—perhaps someone has seen something. I have a full description of what I'm looking for: @<sDesc>.

I tracked down the thief, and he handed the stolen item back to me without any trouble. Now I can return to my client.

I've found the thief. He demanded coins for @<sName>. Not wanting any trouble, I paid the man. Now I have the tool.
#TEXT 6
I found the thief. He tried to feign ignorance, but I intimidated him and he handed over the stolen tool.

I found the thief, but he refused to return the stolen item peacefully. I frightened him, and he fled. Now the stolen tool is lost to me forever...
#TEXT 8
I found the thief. He refused to return the stolen item peacefully and fought back with force.

The locals told me that a vagabond has the tool I'm looking for. That's all the information I have, unfortunately. I doubt the thief could have gone far. I should search the town and its outskirts.

#TEXT 1
@<sName>, a shopowner in @<sCity>, has asked me to do something morally questionable. My task is to cause trouble for his competitor—either capture or sink one of his ships—for @<sMoney>, not to mention any prize loot I might claim. I need to look for the '@<sSName>' @<sType> not far from @<sShore>. I have only @<sDay> to complete this.
#TEXT 2
I was too late. The ship has already sailed, and I won't be getting any cargo. Perhaps it's time to take matters into my own hands and deal with his competitor once and for all. The outcome will be the same... My target is living somewhere in @<sCity>.

That was a good fight. I can return to my employer.

The barman told me that @<sName> is at the local shop. Well, it's time to pay him a visit.
#TEXT 7
The barman told me that @<sName> is currently at sea. I should search for his lugger.

@<sName> has been eliminated. I expect my client will be pleased—no man, no problem.

I've changed my mind. Killing an unarmed man is not my way.

I decided to leave the merchant's lugger alone. Killing a peaceful man is not my way.

The client was satisfied and paid me handsomely.
#TEXT 13
Really?! I went above and beyond, and still he's not satisfied! I don't believe his talk of 'heavy sins'—the man clearly has no conscience. Seems he had his own agenda all along. To hell with him; at least he paid me.
#TEXT 14
I arrived just in time. Surprisingly, the '@<sSName>' is not a @<sType>—it's a heavy galleon. It seems the client was mistaken. But perhaps there are no @<sGoods> in her cargo holds? Either way, I must fight.

#QUEST RedChieftain
Indian Chief
#TEXT 1
Kanauri, the Indian chief, has asked for my help. His tribesmen have been enslaved by the crew of @<sText1>'s ship and are being forced to dive for pearls. I agreed to assist, since I'll receive their entire catch as payment. Two schooners are guarding the Indians, and there's a well-defended camp on the shore. Crucially, I must approach in a small vessel—such as a lugger or sloop—to remain unnoticed. I have only one month to complete this task, so I must not waste any time.
#TEXT 2
I was too late—the Indians must have already been taken away. Ah, that's my fault... I'll put Kanauri ashore at the nearest port; I've failed him.
#TEXT 3
I managed to stay hidden long enough to engage the enemy. The bastards are firing on unarmed fishermen. I must destroy them as soon as possible before the Indians are killed.
#TEXT 4
The chief warned me to use only a single small ship. There's no sign of Indian tartans; it seems the natives have retreated into the jungle. Damn it! I can leave now...
#TEXT 5
The enemy schooners have been destroyed. Now I must go ashore and clear the bay of soldiers to allow the Indians to escape into the jungle. I'm also certain I can find some loot in the fishermen's camp...
#TEXT 6
The schooners were too much for me. Of course, I only had one ship, and it was weaker than any of them. I've had enough—Kanauri will be put ashore at the nearest port. He'd best find another 'savior.'
#TEXT 7
The battle was dreadful; all the Indian tartans have been destroyed. There’s no one left to save. I’ll bring Kanauri to the nearest port—I have failed him.
#TEXT 8
All the enemies are dead. The Indians paid me well and returned to the jungle. I respect men like Kanauri—he is a true chief of his tribe.
#TEXT 9
All the enemies are dead. The Indians paid me in full with the pearls they had gathered, then vanished into the jungle, returning to their village. Their leader even gave me a charmed amulet as a reward, said to make its wearer impossible to drown. I have a deep respect for men like Kanauri—he is a worthy leader of his tribe.

#QUEST FalseTrace
False Trace
#TEXT 1
I had an interesting encounter in the tavern at @<sCity1>. A man named Adam Rayner offered me a deal: he told me about a fluyt, the '@<sShip>', loaded with silver and sailing from Cartagena to @<sCity2>. He demanded one-tenth of the booty. I accepted his terms, as he will be sailing with me and even asked to join the boarding party. Adam didn't mention any specific timing, but I reckon I have only two or three weeks.
#TEXT 2
Despite my efforts, I failed to board the fluyt. No matter—curse the silver.
#TEXT 3
I've sunk the fluyt along with all its silver. How could I have been so careless...
#TEXT 4
Well, isn't that something! There was no silver aboard the fluyt. The captain claims it's just a supply ship meant to deliver provisions. But there was also a woman—clearly the captain's lover. I should summon Adam to my cabin for a word. Let's see what excuse this scoundrel offers. He'd best try damn hard to save his neck from the noose...
#TEXT 5
Adam Rayner has confessed that his plan is to seize the fluyt with my help and reclaim his wife, Katerine Rayner, who has run away from him. He promises to tell me about the gold of some Squint-Eyed Solly as a reward for my services. But first, I must deliver both him and his wife to @<sCity>. Can I trust this rogue? Perhaps I should speak with his wife first—she might know something important...
#TEXT 6
Things are getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam like a dog hates a cat—that's why she ran away from him. But that's their family business and their own problem. I don't care for Katerine or her proposal, so I'll risk trusting Adam again. Off to @<sCity> then.
#TEXT 7
Things are getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam like a dog hates a cat—that's why she ran away from him. She is determined to avenge her lover's death, blaming her husband for orchestrating the attack that led to it. Katerine has offered me a deal: if I kill her husband, she'll reveal the location of his hidden cache. I no longer trust Adam, so I've agreed to her terms. I'll set sail for @<sCity>, but instead of docking in town, I'll land on the nearest shore and deal with Adam there.
#TEXT 8
Things are getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam like a dog hates a cat—that's why she ran away from him. She claims her captain can offer more for their freedom. I should go and speak with the prisoner.
#TEXT 9
The captain's offer was even more suspicious than Adam's. It seems he's trying to set a trap for me. Not a chance! I'd rather trust Adam one more time. I'm heading to @<sCity>.
#TEXT 10
The captain's offer seemed far more profitable and intriguing than Adam's. Whoever lies once will do so again. I'll arrest Rayner and lock him in the cargo hold.
#TEXT 11
Adam Rayner has been arrested, though he put up some resistance. Now he's in chains, and I'm heading to @<sShore>.
#TEXT 12
I was too slow—Adam Rayner stole a boat, took his wife, and escaped from my ship. I doubt I’ll ever see them again...
#TEXT 13
I was too slow, and Squint-Eyed Solly has already claimed his treasure. I should have tried harder...
#TEXT 14
I have delivered Adam and his wife to @<sCity>. Adam told me that Solly hid his loot in a grotto in San Juan del Norte Bay. I'm setting course for the bay—only five days remain.
#TEXT 15
I was too slow, and Squint-Eyed Solly has already claimed his treasure. I should have tried harder...
#TEXT 16
That was one hell of a fight! Solly's bandits have been eliminated. There's so much treasure, it'll take several voyages to haul it all away.
#TEXT 17
As soon as I boarded, I spotted Solly's ship. Well, that's unfortunate for him.
#TEXT 18
As soon as I boarded, I spotted Solly's ship. He was too powerful for me, so I had to retreat and leave all the loot on the shore...
#TEXT 19
My former prisoner has kept his word and given me valuable information: in two weeks, a heavily laden galleon carrying gold ore will set sail from @<sCity> to Europe. I'm on it. I suppose there's no need to worry about Adam...
#TEXT 20
Despite all my efforts, I failed to capture the galleon. Fine, to hell with the gold.
#TEXT 21
I've sunk the galleon along with all its gold. What a fool I am...
#TEXT 22
The heavy galleon has been captured. The captain was right—there was a fortune in gold!
#TEXT 23
Adam Rayner was killed in front of his wife, just as she wished. Strangely, she seemed pleased at the sight of his death. She told me about Adam's hidden cache—it's in Port-au-Prince, near the lighthouse.
#TEXT 24
I've found Adam's cache. His gang ambushed me as I was heading back to my ship. Katerine set the trap, seeking revenge for her lover's death. It wasn't easy, but I managed to kill all four bandits. Katerine was overconfident and stayed to witness my execution—she got a bullet in the skull for her treachery. No more surprises.
#TEXT 25
I found Adam's cache. As I made my way back to the boat, his gang ambushed me—Katerine had set the trap, seeking revenge for her lover's death. It was a hard fight, but I managed to kill all four bandits. Katerine, too sure of herself, stayed to witness my execution. I spared her life and left her on the island.
#TEXT 26
I was attacked as soon as I came aboard. Katerine's threat proved true. I engaged the enemy and destroyed them.

#QUEST Portugal
Long Way to the Gallows
#TEXT 1
I heard an interesting tale from a drunken bounty hunter. It seems the infamous pirate Bartolomeo the Portuguese is somewhere in Philipsburg, searching for a doctor. The Dutch West India Company will pay handsomely for his head. Hugo is right—I can't afford to miss an opportunity like this. I should search the town and find that rat before he slips away!
#TEXT 2
I failed to find the pirate, so there will be no reward for me. Who knows—perhaps it's for the best...
#TEXT 3
Hugo Avendell convinced me to avoid the local authorities and deliver the Portuguese directly to the Company. He believes the local governor will seize our prize and find a way to cheat us. I should change the Portuguese's clothes, as his men might still be in town. I need to find him something suitable to wear.
#TEXT 4
Damn it! I was too slow—the Portuguese managed to escape. The room still reeks of gunpowder. Poor doctor. I can forget about any reward now.
#TEXT 5
The doctor said the Portuguese is in too grave a condition and likely won't survive the journey to Curacao. My last hope is to bring him to Gino Gvineili. If that genius can't help him, no one can. But time is short—we have only three days.
#TEXT 6
I'm too late; the fever did its work. It's a pity the pirate didn't live long enough to face the gallows...
#TEXT 7
We have arrived at Antigua, and the Portuguese is still alive. I won't let my prisoner die before I receive my promised doubloons. Now, everything depends on Gino and his skills.
#TEXT 8
I knew we had lingered here too long! They've finally tracked us down, but these aren't Portuguese men—they're mercenaries. I had to talk them down. Now we have only five days to reach Martinique. My prisoner can rest at the tavern in Saint-Pierre and, with luck, survive the journey to Curaçao. Hugo suspects there are more cutthroats nearby; I may have to fight them yet.
#TEXT 9
I've been summoned to meet His Grace, the governor, on important business. Interesting. In any case, the Portuguese will be staying at the tavern for a few days, so I have enough time to speak with Monsieur Jacques Dyel du Parquet.
#TEXT 10
His Grace has asked me to patrol the waters of his colony for two days; a pirate frigate was reportedly sighted recently. Fear often makes things seem worse than they are, but I could certainly use another 10,000 pesos. I agreed, since I have to stay here for a few days anyway while the Portuguese recovers...
#TEXT 11
Two days have passed, and there is still no sign of the pirate frigate. It's time to report to His Grace.
#TEXT 12
Hugo is a fool! No, that's not quite it... he's a coward! That's the best way to describe him. Why haven't I gotten rid of him before? He never did a thing to help with our business. Fine, he'll lose his share. Now, I should head to the tavern and speak with the barman. He must have seen something!
#TEXT 13
I've learned that our client was taken from us by Franz Garcke and Hernando Vazquez. Hugo knows them—he was terrified and fled the moment our cutthroats arrived. His loyalty to our cause grows more doubtful by the day, but that can wait. I'm certain they've taken our man to Le Francois. Where else would men like them hide, if not under the protection of Jacques the Kindman? I must intercept them there. I should set sail for the port of Le Francois and stop them from taking my prisoner aboard their ship!
#TEXT 14
I've run into Garcke's men, just as I expected. Too bad for them... Now it's time to face their boss—he must be upstairs with my prisoner!
#TEXT 15
The Portuguese has been placed in the room, and our doctor is keeping an eye on him. I'm damn tired of all this... I'd best take a walk around town; I've got two days to rest.
#TEXT 16
I failed to find the Portuguese, and I likely won't. That's a shame.
#TEXT 17
I managed to capture Bartolomeo the Portuguese, but I had to deal with his former companions, who were none too eager to let him live. Once we're clear of this place, I should speak with my prisoner—something is very wrong with him.
#TEXT 18
As I expected, I was attacked by Vazquez's frigate, the "Albatross." Hugo feared him. I emerged victorious, but there was no sign of Vazquez aboard. I'd best speak with my prisoner.
#TEXT 19
As I expected, I was attacked by Vazquez's frigate, the "Albatross." I chose to avoid battle and managed to escape. I need to deliver the prisoner to Curaçao, but first, I should speak with him.
#TEXT 20
Eh, I'm too kind! I've saved the Portuguese so many times that I just can't let him hang. To hell with him—he might abandon me at the very next port...
#TEXT 21
Enough sentimentality with this scum. I've had enough of him... I'm heading to Curaçao to see Matthias Beck.
#TEXT 22
It's done. The Portuguese was delivered to his judges, and the coins are mine. I have to admit, I'm not satisfied with how this turned out. Gino was damn right; saving a man's life only to hang him later... it isn't right.
#TEXT 23
I decided to let Bartolomeo go; after all, he offered a fair price for his freedom. He claims to have a hidden cache on Terks filled with gems stolen from the Company, which is why they're all hunting him. I only hope he wasn't lying to save his own skin... He also warned me about Vazquez—he could become a problem down the line. Now I should search for the treasure before the savages find it. What was it he said? On the hill, beneath the tree?
#TEXT 24
I witnessed a skirmish between the Indians and Dutch marines. What are they doing here? Neither side took kindly to my presence, so I was forced to fight them all. It was a hard battle, but now they all lie dead, and I still stand. Now I can search for the treasure.
#TEXT 25
The Portuguese didn't lie! I've found the gems he spoke of. A fitting end to such a wild tale.
#TEXT 26
A Dutch frigate attacked me near the shores of Terks. I fought her and sent her to the bottom. I doubt they came here just to stroll around this cozy island—there must be some connection to Bartolomeo's treasure. Perhaps I'll learn more in the nearest Dutch colony. I should speak with the tavern folk.
#TEXT 27
A Dutch frigate intercepted me near the shores of Turks, and I decided to retreat. I doubt they came here just to stroll around this cozy island; it must have something to do with Bartolomeo's treasure. Perhaps I'll learn more in the nearest Dutch colony. I should speak with the tavern folk.
#TEXT 28
Why should I care about the Company's intrigues? After all, I have the gems—that's all that matters.
#TEXT 29
It seems I've uncovered what's truly happening. Hernando Vazquez—he didn't dare face me on Martinique. I'm certain he watched his frigate's final battle from a safe distance. Wanting to save his own skin, he told the Company about the gems. He avoided meeting me in Curaçao, which is why he came here, to Philipsburg. He's the one who sent the Dutch expedition to Turks.
Well, Blood Don has lived long enough; it's time to end him before he learns of my presence here. I should go directly to the governor—though perhaps I ought to speak with his servants first.
#TEXT 30
I've changed my mind. Vazquez is no threat to me—the Dutch won't let him live, since they found no gems on Turks. I can breathe easy now; I'm confident.
#TEXT 31
Well, isn't that something! They've captured the Portuguese. Word is, he and Vazquez will be executed in a month. Clearly, the Company plans to interrogate them first. I need to decide my next move. The Portuguese might reveal my involvement in this whole affair...
#TEXT 32
Bartolomeo is being held with his fellow Vazquez in the dungeons of Willemstad. Ha! Should I take the risk, or say to hell with it?
#TEXT 33
I've decided to steer clear of this risky—and, more importantly, worthless—gamble. Even if the Portuguese talks, he won't have much to say. There are hundreds of captains like me out here. Hell, he doesn't even know my name.
#TEXT 34
I freed Bartolomeo from prison. I barely made it out—Vazquez attacked me from behind. Thank God Bartolomeo warned me, and the shot wasn't fatal. Now there's nothing to worry about. I must admit, I had another reason for doing this. Like it or not, Gino was right: we are responsible for those we've tamed.

#QUEST Consumption
Price of Consumption
#TEXT 1
The waitress at the San Jose tavern is desperate—she's convinced that her brother, who was thrown into the local dungeons for smuggling, didn't die of illness as she was told. He may still be in trouble, and I couldn't ignore the tears of such a beautiful girl, so I promised to help. It's odd that her brother died just two weeks after being imprisoned. There's a chance that Señor Commandant is hiding something. I should also speak with the townsfolk about this strange epidemic; sometimes, gossip is the best source of information.
#TEXT 2
I didn't get much from the innkeeper, but he did confirm my suspicions. It seems that consumption has been killing men for a year, and no one cares—or perhaps they just pretend not to notice. I did pick up another clue: there was a smuggler who survived time in the dungeons, only to die later outside the prison. Perhaps I should speak with his associates—they might share some useful details.
#TEXT 3
Señor Commandant did not appreciate my interest. In fact, he all but showed me the door. Still, I must admit, the man was extremely polite and patient. I'll try to find out more about Señor Commandant.
#TEXT 4
The innkeeper has confirmed my suspicions. It seems that consumption has been killing men for a year, and no one cares—or perhaps they simply pretend not to notice. As for Señor Commandant... he was sent here because of some schemes back in Europe. He has fortified his house and never leaves it without guards. The man is certainly hiding something, possibly connected to the consumption in his dungeons. I should investigate his residence. I've also uncovered another clue: a smuggler who had been inside the dungeons and survived. He eventually died, but it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should speak with his associates—they might reveal some details.
#TEXT 5
My suspicions about Señor Commandant are growing stronger. They say he was sent here because of some schemes back in Europe. He has fortified his house and never leaves it without guards. The man is definitely hiding something. There are rumors of something being consumed in his dungeons. I should investigate his house. I also found another clue: a smuggler who had been inside the dungeons and survived. He eventually died, but it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should speak with his associates—they might share some details.
#TEXT 6
It seems our affliction has a name: Juan. Whatever that means, it's clearly not just another sickness that claims lives in the prisons. I should ask the locals about this "Juan."
#TEXT 7
I found an interesting letter inside the Commandant's house. It appears our colonel is dealing with a man whose name begins with 'J'. I also discovered some coins—his share from their last transaction.
Well, I'm beginning to understand what kind of cargo they're dealing in.
#TEXT 8
A Spanish officer approached me in the street, looking troubled. He pleaded with me to stop asking people about Juan and the consumption. He has arranged a meeting outside the town gates tonight. I feel I am on the right track.
#TEXT 9
I was too late—the Spanish doctor is gone. It seems he too fell victim to consumption. A pity.
#TEXT 10
The officer who promised to tell me the truth about the consumption is dead. My only way to reach Juan is gone. A pity.
#TEXT 11
So, Officer Sergio Saldo has told me everything. Señor Commandant is indeed selling his prisoners, disguising their disappearances as deaths from consumption. Funnily enough, his trading partner goes by the name Consumption—Juan 'Consumption'. His men tried to kill us both during our meeting; it seems I’ve alerted their gang. Time to hunt down the rest of them and put an end to this. Sergio told me that Juan’s ship will be sailing near Galera Point until midday. It looks like Angelo still has a chance to return home...
#TEXT 12
The fighting is over and the ship has been sunk. Now I should return to the waitress.
#TEXT 13
I sank Juan's ship with all the prisoners aboard. What a shame! I must be more careful next time...
#TEXT 14
Juan proved too formidable for me, so I chose to retreat—my life is worth safeguarding.
#TEXT 15
I arrived too late at Galera Point—Juan's ship has already sailed. Damn it.
#TEXT 16
Juan, the slave trader, paid me handsomely to spare his life. The young and noble officer Sergio will likely arrest Señor Commandant, but Juan will surely find a way to continue his trade. And the girl... well, it's best she remains unaware of her brother's fate.
#TEXT 17
Juan has escaped his well-deserved fate; I had to let him go to save the slaves. Angelo will return to his sister, and Consumption... perhaps our paths will cross again one day, and I will be able to finish what I started...
#TEXT 18
The story has come to an end. Consumption is dead, and he'll never resume his vile hunt for people. Angelo will return to his sister, just as many others will be reunited with their families today. I'm not certain that Señor Commandant will be punished, but that's no longer my concern...

A nobleman from @<sCity>, by the name of @<sName>, has asked me to negotiate with the local usurer over a family relic. @<sName> has promised to pay me double my expenses in three months' time. This might prove a worthwhile investment. I'll find out what price the usurer demands.

I've changed my mind. People must solve their own problems.

I managed to strike a deal with the usurer. The sum was ridiculous, and I won't even bother going to the nobleman to discuss my reward. Let him keep those coins; he needs them more than I do.

This plant is called Manga Rosa. A merchant girl told me that both the Indians and the Gypsies would pay handsomely for it.

Price of Discretion
#TEXT 1
A man named Bertrand Pinette approached me on the streets of Basse-Terre. He hired me to take him and two companions to Mosquito Bay on the Spanish Main within ten days. I've accepted the job. I am to meet my passengers at Capster Beach at ten o'clock tonight.
#TEXT 2
It's already midnight, and I'm too late to collect my passengers.
#TEXT 3
All passengers are aboard—time to set sail. They're an odd group: a Spanish officer and a French officer, both very secretive and silent. What was a Spanish military man doing on a French island? I have a bad feeling about this.
#TEXT 4
The ten-day deadline has passed, and I still haven't reached my destination. I must make haste.
#TEXT 5
My voyage to Maine took far too long, and the scoundrel passengers tried to mutiny. They're all dead now. Good riddance.
#TEXT 6
The passengers have been delivered. I should put as much distance as possible between myself and the Spanish coast.
#TEXT 7
My instincts were right; delivering Bertrand Pinette and his women brought me more trouble than profit. A runaway war captive, a deserter, and a fraud—what a crew. I’m certain Pinette made a fortune on this voyage. As for me, I’m bound to track him down and bring him back to Guadeloupe. There’s nothing I can do about it; that bastard banker has me over a barrel. I should set sail for Panama, since that was my passengers’ final destination. And next time, I’d best remember to keep my mouth shut!
#TEXT 8
I didn't find Pinette or his ladies in Panama. Figures—he must have lied to me out of caution. I should set course for Portobello now.
#TEXT 9
The bartender gave me some sound advice: speak directly to Don Carlos de Milyar about Pinette. Brilliant. That’s the quickest way to land myself in the local prison. The bartender’s smug expression suggests he knows far more than he’s letting on. I should try to persuade him to share what he knows.
#TEXT 10
No sign of Pinette here, but I did manage to pick up the trail of the third passenger—the French deserter. He’s now a Spanish don, commanding the Sario. A traitor’s reward, no doubt. I have little choice but to board his vessel and capture 'Don Juan.' Even if he can’t reveal Bertrand’s whereabouts, handing him over might help appease the governor of Guadeloupe.
#TEXT 11
It seems luck is on my side—a sloop named "Sario" is anchored in Portobello. Attempting to board her right under the fort's guns would be folly. I should wait until she leaves the harbor and sails into open waters.
#TEXT 12
The Sario is out on the open sea. I must give chase!
#TEXT 13
I made a mistake and attacked Sario in the port of Portobello. Jean-Juan is dead. All leads have vanished, and I have no idea where to find Pinette. I should expect trouble from the French authorities.
#TEXT 14
Don Juan has been captured and is now being held in my cargo hold. I should speak with him about Pinette.
#TEXT 15
I failed to board the Sario and capture Jean-Juan. All leads have vanished, and I have no idea where to find Pinette. I should prepare for trouble with the French authorities.
#TEXT 16
My prisoner is ready to share information about Bertrand Pinette. I’m setting sail for Mosquito Bay.
#TEXT 17
Bertrand Pinette has chosen to continue his shady dealings on Barbados. I should look for him at the island's largest plantation.
#TEXT 18
That bastard Pinette refused to follow me to my ship, so I had to teach him a lesson. I may have trouble with the French authorities, but this particular scoundrel is harmless now.
#TEXT 19
That bastard Pinette refused to follow me to my ship. It was foolish to expect anything else from him. Lesson learned. Now I need to walk around the plantation and devise a plan to capture Monsieur Bertrand by force.
#TEXT 20
I've got a plan: there's a road running from the plantation to the Barbados lighthouse. I'll anchor my ship near the lighthouse and set an ambush for Pinette at the crossroads between the town and the plantation. I need to find a good spot where I can stay hidden long enough. Bertrand often travels to Bridgetown on business, so I doubt I'll have to wait more than a few days for him.
#TEXT 21
I didn't dare attack Pinette; he had an impressive guard. Now I must make my escape—he spotted my ambush and will surely inform the commandant. A pity; I should expect trouble from the French authorities now...
#TEXT 22
Bertrand Pinette is now my prisoner. I should return to Basse-Terre and speak with the banker.
#TEXT 23
It's done. I've got my cash and my reputation. These 150 doubloons won't make up for all my troubles, but it's something. That was the price of my indiscretion.
#TEXT 24
Pinette has offered me an intriguing solution—a letter that incriminates the banker from Basse-Terre. Don Juan was right about the aces up the man's sleeve. It will be a pleasure to see the look on my blackmailer's face. And let's not forget Bertrand's stash waiting for me in a cave on Guadeloupe.
#TEXT 25
Pinette's letter made quite an impression on the banker. He'll keep quiet, that's certain. I should check Bertrand's stash now—it's too risky to leave it there any longer.
#TEXT 26
I was attacked by several mercenaries hired by my banker in Basse-Terre. It seems he considers me a dangerous witness and wants me dead. Very well, I should pay him another visit.

Today, I met a carpenter at the Saint-Pierre shipyard. He told me the shipbuilder wishes to see me. I suspect it will be worth my while—he clearly has need of my services.
#TEXT 2
I've changed my mind and decided not to visit the shipwright.
#TEXT 3
The shipbuilder asked me to attack a Spanish trade convoy, but I wasn't interested and refused.
#TEXT 4
The shipbuilder has tasked me with tracking down a Spanish convoy sailing from Port of Spain, Trinidad, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. I must board the Bensecho, which is carrying rare and valuable resin. If I succeed, I stand to earn about 1,500 doubloons!
#TEXT 5
The Bensecho was sunk in the heat of battle. What a pity.
#TEXT 6
I let the trade convoy and Bensecho slip away. What a pity...
#TEXT 7
I boarded the Bensecho but failed to find enough barrels of resin to satisfy my client. What a shame.
#TEXT 8
The Bensecho was plundered, and I've got the resin in my cargo hold. Time to see my client.
#TEXT 9
It's been over a month since I took this job. The shipbuilder in Saint-Pierre has probably forgotten about me by now.
#TEXT 10
I was deceived in the most brazen manner: the shipbuilder and his lieutenant, Felicien Gronier, tricked me with their little performance, "Arrest of the Good-Hearted Smuggler." I won't let them get away with this. Gregoire Valinnie was right—patience is the key here. I should remain in Saint-Pierre for a while and watch for when the shipyard resumes its work.
#TEXT 11
It didn't take long. Two days, and the shipyard is back to normal. I should pay a visit to the shipbuilder and look into his deceitful eyes.
#TEXT 12
This conman spun me a pitiful tale about his 'terrible time in prison' without batting an eye. He's a seasoned scoundrel—there's no use trying to pressure him. On top of that, he counts a colonial lieutenant among his closest friends and partners in crime. I'll need a plan...
#TEXT 13
It seems I'm not surrounded solely by hordes of bastards and scoundrels—I have friends as well. My old and noble acquaintance, Gregoire Valinnie, has taken it upon himself to track down Felicien Gronier's latest activities. The lieutenant has sailed to Guadeloupe aboard a newly built tartane named 'Topaz.' I should follow him and discover what he's plotting.
#TEXT 14
I took my time and let Felicien Gronier slip away. There's no way I can make up for my losses now.
#TEXT 15
I've spotted the tartane near Guadeloupe, along the deserted shores of Morn l'O Bay. They're unloading goods onto the shore. I'll wait for them to finish, then go ashore and "confiscate" the resin they owe me. They won't be able to escape me there.
#TEXT 16
I got too close to the Topaz and alerted her crew. The tartane is now heading out to open sea, and there's activity along the shore. I've ruined my own plan—there's no point in landing there now. I'm certain those bastards will hide the goods in the jungle.
#TEXT 17
The Topaz has finished unloading and is now sailing away. I should wait a few hours before going ashore. Time to reclaim my resin.
#TEXT 18
We’ve cut down the scum on the shore, but the fight isn’t over yet. Lieutenant Felicien Gronier has arrived in person—seems he had a hunch and returned. Perfect timing, you resin dog! He’s brought five tough fighters with him. They’re standing there like statues, waiting...
#TEXT 19
I decided not to risk facing Felicien Gronier's squad—they looked dangerous. I'd rather walk away with less loot and keep my life. Besides, half the resin is still a very satisfying haul.
#TEXT 20
Felicien Gronier tried to threaten me, but things didn't end well for him or his friends—they'll remain on this shore forever. After tallying everything up, I found that although I only received half of my resin, I also acquired ship silk, hemp ropes, and ironwood. My losses have been more than compensated with profit!
#TEXT 21
The Topaz attacked me as I was leaving the bay. Why this small tartane chose to engage in her final battle remains a mystery to me.
#TEXT 22
I delayed landing on the shore for too long, and Felicien Gronier's men are gone now. A pity, what a shame...

At last, I've delivered the British officers to Antigua. Tomorrow, I should pay a visit to Colonel Fox of the Royal Marines. I hope he'll show some generosity for my efforts.
#TEXT 29
30,000 pesos, an arquebus, and a decent blade. It's a fair reward for my troubles, but this is not a job I'd take on again.
#TEXT 30
I took my time delivering the Brits to Antigua, and they left my ship without so much as a farewell. Very English of them...

Just Like Home
#TEXT 1
Tortuga greeted me with an invitation from the governor's wife to attend her gathering this evening after six o'clock. It will be interesting to observe the local nobility. I just hope I don't run into any angry husbands who've been cuckolded on my account—that sort of trouble was all too common back home.
#TEXT 2
Tortuga's an interesting place. The women here know exactly what they want. I spun a few tall tales for a rather foolish young lady, and now I’m invited to meet her and her friends in the governor’s palace bower tonight, after six o’clock. In Europe, women chase after noble artists from famous families. Here, all you need is a ship. My brother was right; the money was well spent.
#TEXT 3
I've changed my mind. There's no time to concern myself with women's matters.
#TEXT 4
I didn't expect this. Or did I? The local governor's wife wanted me to rob that crazed fanatic. Sure, I need the coin, but not that desperately. The lady wasn't pleased, but I'm out of this story—clean and alive. Should I warn Levasseur about this? I need to decide now.
#TEXT 5
I've decided not to get involved. Family matters are a dirty business.
#TEXT 6
The evening's sweet air of romance vanished quickly. The local governor's wife wants me to rob her own husband—using my hands, of course. The jewels are locked in a chest, and a duplicate key has already been made. At the moment, it's in the possession of some pirate drowning himself in drink at a tavern. How did things come to this, I wonder? Is the lady playing me for a fool, or is she simply foolish herself? Either way, I need the money; Michel won't escape his cell without my help.
#TEXT 7
I told Levasseur about his wife's plans. He didn't take the news well—he went mad, tossed me a beggar's sum of coins, and showed me the door. I think I'm starting to feel sorry for his wife...
#TEXT 8
It's too late to look for the pirate with the key in the tavern. No matter—less intrigue means less trouble.
#TEXT 9
Damn this. Everything is clear now, thanks to my new acquaintance. He was promised the same reward, but had the sense to walk away. I'm no fool myself. Should I warn the husband? I must decide now.
#TEXT 10
My meeting with the pirate proved fruitful—fifty doubloons for the duplicate key and some sound advice. I must be wary of Levasseur's woman; she's clearly trying to play me.
#TEXT 11
The governor's wife asked me to hand over the duplicate key and return the next day for my share. I didn't trust this arrangement and refused. It's time I find the chest myself and claim the booty.
#TEXT 12
I've changed my mind and decided not to help the wife with her scheme. It's too risky. I'll get rid of the duplicate key and put this whole mess behind me.
#TEXT 13
I picked the lock on Levasseur's chest, but I haven't returned to his wife yet. Farewell, you cunning wench—ha-ha.
#TEXT 14
I've changed my mind and decided not to help the wife with her scheme. It's too risky. The very first stage of her plan ended in bloodshed. I didn't even take the duplicate key from the pirate's body—best to forget about this mess altogether.
#TEXT 15
My meeting with the pirate was productive. The bartender and his ladies will have plenty of cleaning to do. I have the duplicate key—time to pay a visit to the wife.
#TEXT 16
It's done. I should meet the governor's wife tomorrow evening to collect my share. Still, as I write this, I feel... odd. Naive, perhaps. Maybe even foolish.
#TEXT 17
This is no laughing matter. A hired thug just tried to kill me, and I have a good idea who sent him. Still, things worked out in my favor—I have the loot, and now I've gained a skilled fighter for my crew. Time to pay the... client a visit.
#TEXT 18

Damn it! That wench really had me fooled. It's my own fault. Nothing to be done now. Still, it was a valuable lesson.

Grandee Albalate
#TEXT 1
Tonight, I helped a man named Don Domingo Albalate out of a difficult predicament. He is a young Spanish grandee and has invited me to visit him in Santo Domingo. His house is situated right by the city gates.
#TEXT 2
I've decided not to sail to Santo Domingo. After all, it's a Spanish city.
#TEXT 3
Don Domingo did not meet me. Instead, I was greeted by some strange and hostile characters. They must have been waiting for Albalate. I should search the area and investigate.
#TEXT 4
I've found the corpse of the real Ugo—don Domingo's retainer. There was also a curious, unfinished note on the table: "Young señor, I don't understand what is really going on yet, but you are in great danger. I know that such words mean nothing to you, but please, for the sake of your father—please, leave the city as soon as you can! I've found documents of your uncle's..." Clearly, someone is after the young don. His loyal retainer tried to warn his master, but was prevented from doing so.
#TEXT 5
I listened to Don Albalate's story and agreed to take him to his plantation in Portobello. He paid handsomely in advance, and it's a good deed to help a young señor in trouble. I'm heading south at full speed before the young grandee's uncle returns from Cartagena.
#TEXT 6
I took too long to reach Portobello, and Don Albalate lost patience and left me.
#TEXT 7
We've arrived at the Portobello plantation. I need to find Luis Ortiz's house and search inside for any clues.
#TEXT 8
I’ve found Ortiz’s accounting book. Domingo became quite agitated after reading the notes—it turns out his uncle had been deceiving him for years by consistently underreporting the true income. Grandee Albalate is heading to Portobello to present the case before the court.
#TEXT 9
That was unexpected. When Don Luis Ortiz and his thugs suddenly appeared, I decided to let them settle their family matters themselves. Besides, I was well paid...
#TEXT 10
Don Diego and I finally confronted Luis Ortiz face to face as soon as we left his house. The bastard tried to bribe me, but failed—and now he’s dead. Alas, the same can be said for poor Grandee Albalate. What a shame... I should get out of here before the authorities decide I’m an accomplice.
#TEXT 11
Don Diego and I finally confronted Luis Ortiz as soon as we left his house. The bastard tried to bribe me, but failed—and now he and his minions are feeding the maggots. Don Domingo intends to settle his affairs with the property right away. I should meet with him tomorrow to claim my reward.
#TEXT 12
This is the end of the curious case of Don Albalate. The young grandee has chosen to take matters into his own hands and take charge of the family business. As for me, I’ve been well rewarded for my efforts.
#TEXT 13
We arrived too late to Portobello—Luis Ortiz had already destroyed any evidence. Don Domingo will have to face his troubles in court. I wish him luck. Still, I did not leave empty-handed; Grandee Albalate gifted me his rapier.
#TEXT 14
I didn't find the young don at Marquee Albalate's house; instead, I was met by his retainer, Ugo. He became extremely nervous when he heard the news about the attack on his master and ran straight to the commandant. I was promptly turned out of the place. Fine, I can live without their famous Spanish "hospitality."

The Final Lesson
#TEXT 1
Today I met Gregoire Valinnie—the very same nobleman who showed me such kindness on my first day in these waters. It feels like ages ago. He invited me to join him in a most promising venture, and I accepted. In a week's time, we are to sail to the coast of Boca de la Serpienta, land there with a squad of fighters, locate the expedition, suppress the Indian resistance, and seize the Company's goods. Risky, to be sure, but the profit could be well worth it.
#TEXT 2
Damn it! Gregoire Valinnie was killed in action. There's no point in continuing without my partner. Rest in peace, friend.
#TEXT 3
We didn't dare engage the Caribs in a decisive skirmish—we're too short on men for that. Better to go without plunder and stay alive. We're leaving.
#TEXT 4
Damnation! Such foolishness... They must have already taken all the goods. Gregoire Valinnie was furious and left my squadron.
#TEXT 5
We managed to salvage part of the cargo from the Carib lair before we were interrupted by English and Dutch vanguards. We should get away from here. Our total plunder: @<sSanl> of ironwood, @<sSilk> of ship silk, @<sRope> of ropes, and @<sOil> of resin. Heading back to Saint-Pierre, Martinique.
#TEXT 6
Victory. Bloody and pointless as it is. There's no way we can take the prize with such heavy casualties. Damn it!
#TEXT 7
Tonight, we'll finalize the deal at Lamentin Bay. Soon, we'll have the money, and others will be left with the illegal cargo. My partner is a man of foresight—there's no doubt about it.
#TEXT 8
I'm at a loss for words. No one in this damned region can be trusted. I managed to get some coin, but... lesson learned, and learned well. I suppose I should be grateful for the experience, but that scoundrel had better hope our paths never cross again.
#TEXT 9
I can't say for certain that it was the toughest fight of my life. But I'm alive, and I have both the cash and the cargo. Another beach, awash in blood. I don't know how I survived, though I have a feeling this is only the beginning, and I've just crossed the point of no return. In any case, thank you for the lesson, monsieur Gregoire. I've learned it well.
#TEXT 10
I can't say for sure that it was the toughest fight in my life. But I am alive, and I have both the cash and the cargo. Another beach swimming in blood. I doubt I would have made it without Prosper. All I know is that no one would come to help me just like that in France. Lesson learned. Rest in peace, my friend. I have spared some coin for your daughter; I am sorry that I can't do more for her.
#TEXT 11
What a shame—Gregoire's vessel was sunk in battle. This is a failure.
#TEXT 12
What a shame—Gregoire's vessel was sunk in battle on our return voyage to Martinique. All the cargo is lost as well.

It took me too long to reach Martinique, and Gregoire sailed off with all the stolen cargo.

I didn't reach Lamentin Bay in time, and the deal went through without me. Gregoire's ship is gone, along with my share.
#TEXT 15
I can't say for certain that it was the toughest fight of my life, but I'm alive—and I've got both the cash and the cargo. Another beach awash in blood. I doubt I would have made it without Prosper. One thing's clear: no one in France would have come to my aid so readily. Lesson learned.

Flying the Jolly Roger: The Amber Rush
#TEXT 1
Marcus Tyrex, the renowned baron of the Brethren and Keeper of the Code, has tasked me with investigating a tale of mysterious blue amber deposits, as told by a Spanish captain. My orders are clear: either find and secure the amber, or prove the story to be nothing more than drunken boasting. My wager is on the latter. I must travel to Santo Domingo and seek out a whore named Gabriela Chapada. I have only three days before this information becomes worthless.
#TEXT 2
It took me too long to reach Santo Domingo. There's no way I can find that Spanish captain now. What a shame to lose the chance to work for a famous pirate just like that...
#TEXT 3
Gabriela has given me the name of my brave soldier—Esberdo Cabanas. He has sailed to Havana to acquire the means to search for amber. Perhaps he was telling the truth after all... I should set sail for Cuba at once.
#TEXT 4
I spent too long investigating in Havana. It's a shame to lose the chance to work for such a famous pirate just like that...
#TEXT 5
I was told at the harbor office that the Cantavro is on patrol, but her location is classified. I'm not foolish enough to approach the commandant about such matters. I should find another way to obtain the information I need.
#TEXT 6
I've arrived in Cuba, but there's no sign of the Cantavro. I should head into the city and investigate.
#TEXT 7
It seems I've found a way to track down Captain Esberdo Cabanas. The enemy of my enemy may well be my ally. I doubt the imprisoned officer holds any fondness for his former captain. I should pay a visit to this lover of wine and women.
#TEXT 8
Ha! That's a start! All I need to do now is help my good friend Lope... I should visit the governor.
#TEXT 9
It's too late to help the prisoner now. There's no way I can catch up to the Cantavro at this point. What a shame.
#TEXT 10
To secure Don Lope's release, I must gather 250 doubloons or thirty thousand pesos. Time is running short...
#TEXT 11
This is done. It cost me a pretty penny, but I believe the final prize will cover my expenses. I should visit my friend Lope tomorrow in his cell. I must also prepare to set sail immediately.
#TEXT 12
Esberdo Cabanas is operating along the Mosquito Coast. I must make haste—I have only about seven days!
#TEXT 13
I didn't reach the Mosquito Coast in time. This is a disaster. What a shame—there's no point in meeting Tyrex now.
#TEXT 14
I managed to chase down the Cantavro and her longboats, yet I failed to plunder even a single piece of blue amber. What a shame!
#TEXT 15
I managed to plunder several longboats, but the total haul is a meager @<sQty> pieces. There's no point in visiting Tyrex with such a paltry amount of loot.
#TEXT 16
The plunder proved to be quite fortunate; I've managed to gather @<sQty> pieces of blue amber, along with some ordinary amber. I should pay Tyrex a visit and boast about my haul.

Flying the Jolly Roger: The Silk Road
#TEXT 1
Tyrex must be testing the limits of my patience. Instead of chasing down trading caravans, I'm tasked with finding a steady buyer for a rare commodity—ship silk. I have no idea where to begin. For now, I should meet with Bald Geffrey, captain of the galleon Snake, in Capsterville on St. Christopher.
#TEXT 2
I've wasted too much time, and Bald Geffrey has likely decided to act on his own without waiting for instructions from Tyrex. What a shame...
#TEXT 3
Thank you, Tyrex! The smugglers are offering a price Marcus won't accept, and the stores aren't an option. Someone out there must need this silk, since the smugglers are clearly reselling it. I need to use my head—who are the main buyers of ship silk? If I can figure that out, I'll find a buyer.
#TEXT 4
I spoke with the shipbuilder in Capsterville, but our conversation led nowhere. Still, I feel I'm on the right track. The shipbuilder needed ropes from Russia—but who in these parts would be interested in silk from Lyons?
#TEXT 5
I've found a potential buyer for my silk, but unfortunately, we didn't see eye to eye. Either he suspects me of being a snitch, or he simply refuses to deal with strangers. Still, I saw a glint in his eye when I mentioned the silk... I wager the sly dog already has a regular supplier, and it's not the governor. Pressing the master further won't help; I need to find his suppliers. There's a pirate lair on Jamaica—Maroon Town. I should head there and investigate.
#TEXT 6
A bartender in Maroon Town can direct me to a man who knows everything about what’s happening in these waters. I need to gather 50 doubloons for the greedy bastard.
#TEXT 7
It seems I need to find a man called Husky Billy, a former pirate who now fishes near Jamaica in his old longboat. I should wait for him not far from Negril Cape. His vessel is called the Fly Fish.
#TEXT 8
Billy can point me to the silk supplier, but he wants a new longboat and a roll of ship's silk in exchange. I have three days to deliver everything to him before he sets sail for the open sea.
#TEXT 9
According to Husky Billy, every month between the 10th and the 15th, a brigantine called Utrecht smuggles silk to the headmaster of Port Royal's shipyard. I need to eliminate my competitor. I could inform the governor—let the Brits handle the dirty work and gain their favor at the same time. Or, I might intercept the Utrecht at sea myself. She should be approaching Jamaica from either Curaçao or St. Maarten. In any case, removing her will make the client much more agreeable.
#TEXT 10
I failed to deliver the longboat and silk to Husky Billy in time. The pirate must be far away by now. There's no point in telling Tyrex about my failure.
#TEXT 10-1
It's been a week, and there's still no sign of the Flying Fish. I must have missed her arrival. A shame—there's no need to trouble Tyrex now.
#TEXT 11
So, the Utrecht lies at the bottom of the sea, along with my competitors. I should make landfall at Portland Cove to speak with the buyers.
#TEXT 12
Damn it! The bay is empty; someone was here just recently, but now they're all gone. I must have fought too close to shore. I doubt the shipbuilder can be persuaded after what's happened. There's no point in seeing Tyrex now. This is a total failure.
#TEXT 13
I missed the Utrecht. I was so close, yet I failed to find her at sea.
#TEXT 14
A failure! I wasted my chance to strike a deal with the worker; he mistook me for a patrol officer, panicked, and foolishly attacked. Fool. I had to kill them all. It's a shame, but this business is finished.
#TEXT 15
It's done. I managed to strike a deal with the worker—25 doubloons for a roll. Now I should sail to St. Christopher and meet with Bald Geffrey.
#TEXT 16
It's been two months already. Bald Geffrey has likely sold his silk to someone else by now. A pity... but I can still deliver the information about the buyer to Tyrex. I should reach La Vega within ten days to give Tyrex time to gather enough silk. Hopefully, that will ease any anger he might have.
#TEXT 17
All deadlines have long passed. There's no sense in making Tyrex uneasy just by lingering here.
#TEXT 18
It's been two months already, and I still have no leads on potential buyers. This is a complete failure; there's no point in sailing to Tyrex now.
#TEXT 19
I passed the information I received from Husky Billy to the local authorities. Now, I must wait for them to deal with my competitors. I should meet with the governor by the 16th day of @<sTemp> month.
#TEXT 20
It's done. My competitor was eliminated by a military patrol. I was even rewarded with 10,000 pesos, which is a pleasant bonus. I should visit the shipbuilder; he ought to be more cooperative now.
#TEXT 21
It's done. I managed to strike a deal with the shipbuilder—25 doubloons for a roll. Now I should sail to St. Christopher and meet with Bald Geffrey.
#TEXT 22
Bald Geffrey has his orders—he's about to set sail for Jamaica with the first shipment of ship silk from Marcus Tyrex. I should make my way to La Vega.

Flying the Jolly Roger: Hot Sun of Maracaibo
#TEXT 1
This time, my mission is to liberate a former privateer named Jean Picard from slavery. He's being held captive on a plantation in Maracaibo. I've been given command over another pirate, the rather dim-witted Pelly the Cutlass, and his barquentine, the Moray, to assist me. Pelly will be waiting for me at Cape Ragged Point in Barbados. Gaining entry to the plantation will require a clever ruse. Since they're surely in need of more slaves, I'll pose as a slave trader. Acquiring fifty individuals should suffice—I can either seize them at sea or visit Fadey on Guadeloupe. He's proven himself adept at procuring whatever one desires. But these details can wait; it's time to set sail for Barbados.
#TEXT 2
I was foolish enough to waste too much time on my way to Barbados. I've failed. It's a shame to ruin the job and let Marcus down...
#TEXT 3
Pelly the Cutlass has orders to sail to Maracaibo, drop anchor at Guajira Bay, and wait for my arrival. It will take the Moray about a week to get there. As for me, I must head straight into the lion’s den—a plantation near Maracaibo. Jean Picard should be somewhere on the grounds. To avoid suspicion, I’ll pose as a slave trader; bringing fifty slaves should make my story convincing enough.
#TEXT 4
I was foolish enough to waste a lot of time—it's a failure. It's a shame to have ruined the job and let Marcus down...
#TEXT 4-1
I've heard rumors that the pirate captain Jean Picard was killed by a guard on the plantation. That was entirely my doing.
#TEXT 5
Here I am at the plantation, posing as a merchant. I should focus on finding Jean Picard now.
#TEXT 6
I've found Jean, but it's unwise to discuss his escape in front of the guards. I should wait until nightfall and find Picard in one of the shacks.
#TEXT 7
The plan is simple and direct. Picard's men will spark a riot from within, while Pelly the Cutlass and I attack from the outside. Before the assault, I must make sure Jean's pirates are well armed. We can easily take 30 common sabers and axes from the ship's arsenal, but the rest must be found elsewhere. I'll need 30 pistols with enough ammunition, up to 90 potions for medical needs, and it wouldn't hurt to have 2 muskets with 20 charges each. I'll speak with Pelly about our strategy, then head to Guadeloupe to see Fadey. The Muscovite should be able to procure all the supplies we need.
#TEXT 8
The weapons have been gathered. I should consider how to deliver them to the plantation in secret. It's time I speak with Picard about this.
#TEXT 9
Picard is no fool, which sets him apart from Tyrex's other pawns. The weapons will be delivered to the plantation hidden in crates of trade goods. I need to offer them 500 boxes of either coffee, copra, or vanilla.
#TEXT 10
The goods exchange agreement is set; the deal will take place tomorrow evening. I need to find Picard and let him know.
#TEXT 11
I ruined the deal by not bringing enough goods to trade. It's a shame everything fell apart because of my own foolishness...
#TEXT 12
I must take my ship to Guajira Bay and prepare to storm the plantation with Pelly at my side before midnight.
#TEXT 13
I ruined everything by failing to arrive at the rendezvous point on time.
#TEXT 14
My crew ventured too close to the plantation entrance and set off the alarm. Our rescue plan is now completely ruined.
#TEXT 15
I failed to reach the plantation in time. Our rescue plan is completely ruined...
#TEXT 16
I must have been too slow in gathering weapons for the rescue. Jean Picard and his men are gone from the plantation—either they've been sold elsewhere or tortured to death. It's over.
#TEXT 17
We managed to start a riot, but Jean Picard was killed in the fighting. It's over.
#TEXT 18
It's done! But it's too soon to celebrate—a Spanish squadron is bearing down on us. I've ordered Picard and Cutlass to escape aboard the Moray. As for me, I'm preparing to engage the Spaniards.
#TEXT 19
The enemy commands a formidable force. I should sink his flagship to sow confusion, then make my escape.
#TEXT 20
A battle well fought. I'm heading to La Vega to see Tyrex immediately.
#TEXT 21
It's done—we've escaped into the jungle. Now we must make for Guajira Bay before more Spaniards arrive.
#TEXT 22
I've decided to refuse the services of the esteemed Fadey and arrive at the Maracaibo plantation without the required goods. They won't be inspecting my hold. It's risky, of course, but there's no turning back now. Come what may.
#TEXT 23
The advance has been paid, and tomorrow at ten o'clock I am to receive the shipment of slaves I need at Capster Beach. We must not be late, so as not to let Fadey down.
#TEXT 24
That's it—my money is gone, lost along with the slaves because I was late for the meeting. What a fool I am. Now I'll have to show up at the Maracaibo plantation empty-handed.
#TEXT 25
The deal is done—fifty heads of black gold now fill my hold. Gold indeed, considering how dearly this venture has cost me; I doubt I'll even cover my expenses. From now on, I must look after my own interests, not line the pockets of others. Regardless, I press on with the operation to rescue a certain Jean Picard...
#TEXT 26
I've decided not to get involved with the slaves; that's far beyond my means at the moment. I'll try to show up at the Maracaibo plantation without the required goods—this way, they won't inspect my hold.
#TEXT 27
My naivety played a cruel joke, and I could not portray myself as a slave trader. I'm sorry I messed things up so stupidly and let Marcus down...
#TEXT	28
I'm faced with a difficult choice. To quickly secure the cargo I need, Cutlass has given me a tip he’d been saving for himself—a large caravan transporting coffee and other spices. In two weeks, a French trade squadron will pass near Guadeloupe. I can't help but wonder if Cutlass offered this lead to help us complete our mission swiftly, or if he's testing whether I have the nerve to attack my own countrymen like a true pirate. Either way, I'll keep this in mind, but I won't feel bound to it—there are always other caravans to plunder, or even legitimate ways to buy the goods I require.
#TEXT	29
I can hardly believe my own boldness and good fortune! After gathering enough gold, I strode openly into the plantation and purchased Picard. The plantation owner may have suspected my true intentions, since I made it clear I was interested in Jean and didn't fool him with my tale about needing a pretty servant to pour wine at parties. But it matters little—what's important is that Picard is free, without bloodshed or risk to his life. Now we can return to Marcus Terrax.
#TEXT	30
Funny thing—at first, Cleaver tried to make me spend a fortune on one deal, and when I refused, he convinced me to spend it on something entirely different. Paul seems deeply concerned about Picard's well-being—not out of kindness, but out of fear of Marcus's harsh punishment if we fail. So, when I turned down the idea of buying Jean, Cleaver insisted we urgently provide everyone with weapons and medicine. To be precise, he "helpfully" took care of the task himself—for the same sum it would've cost to purchase Picard. Maybe it was an impulsive expense, but I was growing weary of hand-picking every single high-quality pistol for our escapees! Speaking of them—it's time to visit Handsome and let him know that the weapons are ready.

#TEXT 11
I ran into my old acquaintance, Jean Picard, who was about to tip off Marcus about Pasquale Lavoisier's greed. Not the wisest move, so I warned him. Picard then suggested I reclaim what Pasquale owes me. Sounds promising. I should meet him in two weeks at Gonaives Bay. It seems Jean has a plan to outsmart that four-eyed miser.
#TEXT 12
Jean Picard has a plan to break into the house of Pasquale Lavoisier and Tyrex in La Vega. We must finish everything before dawn.
#TEXT 13
I was late for my meeting with Jean. A pity.
#TEXT 14
I arrived at Gonaives Bay on foot, which made Picard furious. Jean left without telling me his plan. What a shame...
#TEXT 15
The robbery went well. My share should exceed 100,000 pesos, which will cover Lavoisier's debt to me.
We parted ways with Jean Picard at Gonaives Bay. He told me he's quitting and suggested I do the same. His words about Tyrex ring true, but not yet. For now, I should find Marcus and report to him about Ignacio Marco.
#TEXT 16
The robbery went smoothly. My share should exceed 100,000 pesos, more than enough to cover Lavoisier's debt to me. I also stopped Jean from killing a witness—a whore belonging to Tyrex. Perhaps I'm getting soft, but a woman on Isla Mona might prove useful, heh. She won't be able to escape from there anyway.
We parted ways with Jean Picard at Gonaives Bay. He told me he's quitting and suggested I do the same. His words about Tyrex ring true, but not yet. For now, I should find Marcus and report to him about Ignacio Marco.
#TEXT 18
We spent too much time in the jungle on our way to La Vega and didn't dare attempt the robbery. Jean was very upset. I should find Marcus and report to him about Ignacio Marco.
#TEXT 19
I completely forgot about Jean Picard's offer. What a pity.

Flying the Jolly Roger: Stones of Blood and Forest
#TEXT 1
My next mission is to find and plunder the Spanish mining village of Merida. Jean Picard will accompany me. Tyrex has also assigned one of his buccaneers to my crew—Luka Bayard, also known as Leprechaun. I should meet him and his men at the port of La Vega.
#TEXT 2
I was distracted by other matters, and now Picard and Leprechaun have left my ship. What a shame...
#TEXT 3
Our destination is Cape of Delusive Hopes, south of Lake Maracaibo. There's no time to waste!
#TEXT 4
Here we are in the Spanish Main. We need to find an Indian village and speak with their chieftain about getting a guide to Merida.
#TEXT 5
The chieftain isn't much of a talker. The leprechaun was right—there's no way I'll make any progress without bringing gifts.
#TEXT 6
The Indian chieftain Kumwana has promised to gather his warriors and speak with them. I should meet him tomorrow morning to hear his answer.
#TEXT 7
Cowardly redskins! Not a soul is willing to guide me to Merida—they all fear some Capongas lurking in the jungle. This is a problem; I should speak with Leprechaun.
#TEXT 8
The plan isn't exactly promising, but I'll give it a try. I'll attempt to win over the Indian women with gifts and promises—perhaps one of them can persuade her husband to help us. There's another option as well: putting pressure on the chief. I'll present him with such an unpleasant alternative that he'll be forced to find me a guide within a day. Before we leave the village, I must also bring Leprechaun more vials of antidote.
#TEXT 8a
I've made it clear to the chief of the natives what awaits him and his entire village if they don't find me a guide within 24 hours. He mentioned someone named Tagofa who might be able to lead us to Merida. Well, we'll see... I'll return in a day. Let's see how reasonable this native truly is.
#TEXT 9
An Indian girl named Hayami has promised to speak with her husband, Tagofa. I should meet them both after sunset.
#TEXT 10
Tagofa agreed to guide us to Merida, but his cunning woman demanded payment in advance: two pistols—a dueling pistol and a blunderbuss—each with thirty charges. She also wants a spyglass, an emerald necklace, and a gold ring set with a ruby.
#TEXT 11
Tagofa has joined my crew. To reach Merida, we'll need six longboats. Since the Lokonos lack proper longboats, we'll have to build them ourselves. For this, we'll need twenty bundles of planks, ten bales of leather, and an officer to oversee the construction—a designated carpenter.
#TEXT 12
It didn't take long to persuade the governor of Merida to part with all the mined stones. Picard was right—it's a heavy load. There's nothing left to do here. Time to return to our longboats.
#TEXT 13
The reckless Capongas ambushed us inside the cave. I had to take down another one of their groups.
#TEXT 14
The longboats are ready. I should have a word with Tagofa.
#TEXT 15
We were attacked by the infamous Capongas I've been hearing so much about lately. They're all dead now, and Merida is close by.
#TEXT 16
The Spanish proved to be far too suspicious and aggressive—they didn't hesitate to attack my crew. That was the last mistake they ever made. Merida's garrison has been wiped out, and all her defenders are dead. Time to break down the gates.
#TEXT 17
The last Spaniards, eager for a glorious death, have fallen. It's time to pay the governor a visit.
#TEXT 18
The booty was divided fairly, and my efforts to free Jean from slavery have been fully compensated. Fortune smiles on me. Now it's time to sail to La Vega and report to Tyrex.
#TEXT 19
It took me too long to gather gifts for the red-skinned couple. The Leprechaun and Jean decided they could manage without me. Perhaps it's for the best!
#TEXT 20
I was too slow, so Leprechaun and Jean decided they could do better without me. Probably for the best!

Flying the Jolly Roger: Master of Trickery
#TEXT 1
Alas, Marcus has no more profitable work for me. However, the Master of the Codex has a personal request—I am to escort the Kitty to Bridgetown, Barbados. I am obliged to please my patron. The ship is currently in the waters near La Vega.
#TEXT 2
It seems I drank too much rum, and now the Kitty has sailed off to Bridgetown without me. What a shame...
#TEXT 3
The Kitty was sunk in a naval battle. What a shame... There's no way I can face Marcus now.
#TEXT 4
Well, well! Ignacio Marco approached me in Bridgetown and offered to partner with me in an attack on a Dutch silver caravan. This is the same Marco who set up Jean Picard. I accepted his offer—the prize is too tempting to pass up—but I must be cautious with this man. Amusingly, the caravan has stopped on an island I already know well...
#TEXT 5
Well, well! Ignacio Marco approached me in Bridgetown and offered a partnership to attack a Dutch silver caravan. This is the same Marco who set up Jean Picard. I accepted his offer—the prize is too tempting—but I must be cautious with this man. The caravan is anchored near the island at these coordinates: 12° 48' North, 64° 41' West.
#TEXT 6
The caravan is indeed here. Ignacio Marco didn't lie. Very well, it's time to relieve the Dutch of their cargo.
#TEXT 7
The fighting with the Dutch is over. Ignasio Marco is signaling to me from his polacre; it seems he wants to go ashore to divide the plunder, as expected. I'm about to join him, but I'll also post a watchman on the nearest hill with a spyglass. I need to make sure the horizon remains clear.
#TEXT 8
My caution has served me well—this bastard Ignasio Marco is working with the Castilians. It's the same scheme that befell Picard: a job with a partner near South Main, splitting the spoils, then the Spanish squadron swoops in. If not for my watchman, they'd have caught me just as they did Picard. I still have time to escape... I hope.
#TEXT 9
I'm not sure I should engage this Spanish squadron. I believe fleeing is the best option in this situation. I'll need at least 3,000 yards between us to have a chance of escape.
#TEXT 10
I fought a fierce battle against the Spanish heavy squadron and destroyed them. Now they know what it means to face a true corsair. I should make haste and report to Tyrex as soon as possible.
#TEXT 11
I've managed to escape from the Spanish squadron. I should make haste and see Tyrex as soon as possible.
#TEXT 12
The mighty flagship has been destroyed. Now we can attempt to escape—all we need is to put 1,000 yards between us and them.

#QUEST Roger_7
Flying the Jolly Roger: Jarl's Treasures
#TEXT 1
Another riddle from Tyrex: I must set sail for an unknown destination in search of the treasure left by the recently deceased pirate, Wulfric Jogansen. All I have is his logbook. I should retire to my cabin and study it carefully, taking my time to glean as much information as possible.
#TEXT 2
I found a lead in Wulfric's ship log—Mosquito Bay. It seems he visited there quite often. The bay leads to several caves deep within the mainland. I should investigate them.
#TEXT 3
I was attacked by enraged Caribs in a grotto in Mosquitoes Bay. It seems I interrupted some ritual they were performing around a fire. It never gets easier. Now I can search for the treasure in peace.
#TEXT 4
Alas, there's no sign of any treasure inside the grotto at Mosquito Bay.
#TEXT 5
I found a chest with rather interesting contents, though I'm certain it's not Red Wulf's treasure.
#TEXT 6
I came across some beggars at the cave's exit. It appears the stash I found earlier was theirs.
#TEXT 7
This lead was a dead end. I should have expected more from Red Wolf—he's not like those other poor bastards who stash their loot in roadside caves. Best I return to my cabin and try again.
#TEXT 8
I've got another lead. Wulfric has been regularly visiting a certain Gaspard Parmentier in Tortuga. He might be the Viking's personal banker. I should look into this.
#TEXT 9
I've learned how to find Gaspard's place. I should go there and discreetly ask about the Red Wolf. Best to visit during the day—bankers aren't fond of guests after dark, heh-heh.
#TEXT 10
Gaspard Parmentier's house is nearby. I knocked on the door several times, but there was no answer. Still, I heard footsteps inside. Clearly, this banker is hiding from men like me—strangers he doesn't trust. I should wait by the hatch to the dungeons and keep watch on the entrance.
#TEXT 11
Blimey! My old friend Pelly the Cutlass has arrived at Gaspard's, and the door magically opened for him. This is insulting. I should wait for Cutlass to leave, then ask around about him at Gaspard's. Pelly is a fool; he'll tell me everything I need to know.
#TEXT 12
Another dead end! Gaspard Parmentier, also known as Goldenteeth, is nothing more than a common fence for stolen gems and jewels. I should return to my cabin and reconsider my next move.
#TEXT 13
I keep encountering the word "gord" in various places. What on earth does it mean? With no other solid leads to pursue, I should investigate further. My friend Gino might be able to help me unravel this mystery. I'm heading to Antigua.
#TEXT 14
I've noticed the word 'gord' cropping up here and there. What on earth does it mean? I need to find out, as I have no other solid leads to pursue. I'm heading to La Vega to ask Tyrex for help with this.
#TEXT 15
So, Wulfric the Viking had a secret base somewhere in the Archipelago! I wager that's where his treasure is hidden. I should return to my cabin and try to determine its location using his ship's log.
#TEXT 16
I believe I've found the location of the hoard I've been searching for. It's on an island that isn't marked on any map. I should explore it.
#TEXT 17
I was suddenly attacked in the jungle by a horde of pirates. They must be Wulfric's men, unaware of his fate. I should gather a boarding party and press on.
#TEXT 18
This is it—I have found Wulfric's hoard. Only three of his men survived, and they have joined my crew: a carpenter named Rodgar and two of his helpers. Now to search for the treasure. It must be hidden here, and hidden well.
#TEXT 19
I've found Red Wolf's treasure—a hell of a haul: 750,000 pesos and 900 doubloons. A third goes to Tyrex, and the rest is mine by right. I'll keep the secret of this island to myself. This is now my base, my stronghold. I can repair ships and store goods here. One day, I might build and expand even further.
#TEXT 20
I now have my very own base! Its coordinates are 18° 42' North, 72° 9' West. The island is called Isla Mona. Rodgar Janssen will remain here to oversee the village and handle repairs on my ships. Time to find Tyrex and report in.

#QUEST Roger_8
Flying the Jolly Roger: Corrida
#TEXT 1
Marcus has ordered me to investigate the situation in Martinique. They say Ignacio Marco was spotted there. I am to keep an eye on the bastard, but I'm forbidden to attack him—Marcus has his own plans for him.
#TEXT 2
The Torero is raiding Le Francois, accompanied by a frigate and a corvette. My friend must be here, then. I should make for Le Francois and avoid asking anyone about Marco and his crew. My task is to watch and observe.
#TEXT 3
Ignacio Marco spent nearly two hours at the residence of Jacques Barbason, the head of Le Francois. Afterwards, he made his way to the port accompanied by two stern gentlemen, likely captains of the other ships. I should make haste to St. Pierre and continue tracking their movements.
#TEXT 4
Ignacio Marco had already set sail by the time I reached my ship. No matter. I've gathered some valuable information; I should report it to Marcus.
#TEXT 5
I failed to reach Marcus within three weeks, and his plan was ruined. What a shame. Still, I'm not out of the game yet—I should return in a month with a single powerful ship. And I must never be late again.
#TEXT 6
So, I'm to carry out Marcus's complex plan. The first stage: I must intercept the Torero, which is sailing from Cuba to Philipsburg. It's best to attack her near Sint Maarten, but not too close to the island—otherwise, Barbason's pirates might notice the fight.
#TEXT 7
I've sunk the Torero in the heat of battle. What a shame. I should report to Marcus.
#TEXT 8
I successfully boarded the Torero, but couldn't find her log. There's no way to get the information we need now. What a shame. I should go see Marcus.
#TEXT 9
I engaged the Torero too close to Sint Maarten and was spotted by other pirates. What a disgrace. I should go see Marcus.
#TEXT 10
I have successfully boarded the Torero. Ignacio Marco refused to surrender, but I still have his logbook. I should return to my cabin and examine it.
#TEXT 11
Now I have all the information I need. Pigeon Spyke is on his way to Tyrex. It's time to signal Barbason's squadron near Sint-Maarten to set sail for Puerto Rico. I should keep my distance, though—1,500 yards from Philipsburg's fort should suffice.
#TEXT 12
What a shame. I gave the wrong signal to Barbason's pirates. I should return to Marcus.
#TEXT 13
What a shame. I got too close to Barbason's pirates and compromised the Torero's true legend. I should return to Marcus.
#TEXT 14
The signal has been sent! The pirates are heading straight for Puerto Rico, where the Spanish ambush awaits. I must hurry to intercept the gold caravan. I hope Marcus's reinforcements arrive in time.
#TEXT 15
What a shame! I've wasted too much time and failed to find the Spanish gold convoy. I should return to Marcus.
#TEXT 16
What a shame! I completely forgot Marcus's instructions not to add any ships to my squadron except the Torero. Now that pirate will be after me for some time. I'd best return to Marcus.
#TEXT 17
The promised reinforcements did not disappoint—Marcus himself has arrived to aid me aboard the Red Dragon, his warship! The Spanish are gone. I should take a longboat.
#TEXT 18
Unfortunately, we didn't get any gold from this venture. I should meet Marcus in three weeks—he'll be arriving on a single warship. Something significant is on the horizon.
#TEXT 19
Unfortunately, we didn't get as much gold from this as we'd hoped. I should meet Marcus in three weeks; he'll be arriving on a single warship. Something big is on the horizon.
#TEXT 20
The plunder was good, though Tyrex had hoped for more. I am to meet Marcus in three weeks, and he'll be arriving on a single warship. Something big is brewing; I hope it proves more rewarding than the last raid.
#TEXT 21
Tyrex and I are well satisfied with the size of our prize. I am to meet Marcus in three weeks, and he’ll be arriving on a single warship. Something significant is on the horizon; I hope it proves even greater than this last raid.
#TEXT 22
Despite my failure, Tyrex was not truly angry with me. I am to meet Marcus in three weeks, commanding a single warship. Something significant is on the horizon; I hope it will be grander than the last raid.
#TEXT 23
I was too late—Tyrex has already set out on the raid. What a shame!
#TEXT 24
I failed to find the Torero on the high seas. All is lost... I should return to Marcus.
#TEXT 25
I completely forgot Markus's instructions—not to waste a minute and make all haste to Sint Maarten. Instead, I tended to my own affairs. Naturally, I found no sign of Torero. I'm returning to Markus to confess.

What a party we had yesterday: the rum, the women—La Vega has much to offer Charlie Prince. I'm respected here! I love this life!

I've made a grave mistake! My so-called exceptional navigation skills have driven the others to abandon me.

I've arrived in the city of Cartagena. My first task is to eliminate the guard ships.
#TEXT 4
The Spanish squadron has been eliminated. I should board the Red Dragon.
#TEXT 5
Tyrex and I are preparing to bombard the fort at Cartagena. It gives me pause, but the Red Dragon is a fortress in her own right.
#TEXT 6
The resistance has been crushed. Cartagena is ours! Marcus is heading to the fort for the gold, and I've been ordered to collect a ransom from the governor.
#TEXT 7
I made the Spanish pay even more than Marcus demanded—the ransom of 350,000 pesos is secured. Now, I'm heading to the fort.
#TEXT 8
The gold from Cartagena has been loaded onto our ships. My share is @<sGold> pieces of gold and @<sMoney> pesos. It's a rich prize, and the split is fair... mostly. I didn't care for Marcus dividing the gold without me—especially since he took a bloody half! True, the lead was his, and he had the largest ship... No matter. I have new orders. I should set sail for Tortuga and squander my coin there. Whores and rum—rest assured, I won't disappoint!

Life is good! Janette's brothel won't forget me anytime soon, ha-ha! It cost me a pretty penny, but I've already got a new lead: my new sweetheart, Camilla, is offering me a treasure map to a lost city of gold miners. I'm sure it's no scam, since she was planning to sell it to Marcus in the first place. She'll be waiting for me at the church from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. I should prepare 200 doubloons for her.
#TEXT 2
I have Camilla's map. I should study it carefully and be ready for anything. I need to prepare munitions, healing potions, and antidotes in case things take a turn for the worse.
#TEXT 3
Here it is—Caratasca Lagoon. A wild, deserted shore. My journey to the ruins begins here.
#TEXT 4
An obstacle! I'll clear the way with explosives, no doubt. Someone has already been here recently. I'm heading back to my ship to fetch some gunpowder.
#TEXT 5
The barrels are filled with gunpowder and ready. I need to light the fuse and take cover.
#TEXT 5-1
My plan worked perfectly! The path is clear!
#TEXT 6
I've found the ruins. There must be a way into the dungeons where the treasure is buried somewhere nearby.
#TEXT 7
Camilla, that wench! She sold the map not only to me, but to Cutlass as well! I never would have thought greed could blind someone so completely. We used to be good partners... Seems the poor bastard was always jealous of me.
I've found the treasure, but it's locked behind iron bars. I should fetch some tools from the ship.
#TEXT 8
Damn it! That hurts! Jeffrey set me up—the greedy bastard. That's the second so-called 'friend' from the Brethren who's tried to kill me today over gold. I need to get out of here right now. Something's not right. Who else might show up—Picard? We had an agreement, but nothing is certain anymore. Jeffrey's men are still lurking about; I overheard some scum mention a musketeer unit he brought along.
#TEXT 9
Unfortunately, instead of finding Jean, I ran into Luke Leprechaun here. He and his buccaneers had set an ambush upstairs. It seems the old forester always held a grudge against me. So much for trusting bandits and pirates as friends!
I don't see this as a mere game of chance. There's something in the air—I should get out of here!
#TEXT 10
All of this was orchestrated... A damned avenger of the people set a trap for me. The man's name is Don Henrico, and the worst part is that his accusations are completely justified and true.
I'm all alone in this dark, eerie, and silent dungeon. I'm surrounded by the dead—there aren't even any rats here. I still have a little time to find a way out before starvation claims me.
#TEXT 11
I found a rusty key on a skeleton, and it opened a door leading downstairs. Perhaps this is my way out?

It's a miracle! I found an old silver key on the stairs!

I did it! It's like being born a second time... I suppose I've earned this punishment. I am a monster.
It's time to part ways with Marcus Tyrex and leave the life of piracy behind. No doubt I'll cross paths with their schemes again, but I'll never be one of them. Pirate Charlie Prince died in the dungeons of the dead city.
I, Charles de Maure, French captain and nobleman, swear to myself and my conscience:
... I swear that no other civilian will suffer by my hand or by the hands of my crew.
... I swear to protect women, regardless of their status or nationality.
... I swear that the lure of gold will never again cloud my judgment.
... I swear to put an end to the deeds of any villains I encounter on my journey.
... I swear that between wealth and honor, I will always choose honor.
... I swear that, under any circumstances and in any company, I will remain an honorable man.
There's much to be done if I'm to restore my good name—but I will see it done. For now, I must head to St. Pierre to meet with Michel. Life goes on!

#TEXT	19
When I finally made my way back to shore, still wavering between madness, fear, uncertainty, and hope, my loyal friend and comrade, @<pcharname>, was there to meet me. Thank God, he survived this day as well. In a long conversation, he helped me see things more clearly—and make the right decision. Charlie Prince, the pirate who danced to Terrax's tune, died today among those geysers. Charles de Maure, the French nobleman—not some wretched pirate—lives on. And from now on, no one will tell him what to do. No one will stand between him and his ambitions. I alone will choose my path and how to reach my goals. I'll visit my brother and tell him plainly that nothing good ever came from his precious Terrax. Let him say what he will—I’ll find my own way.
#TEXT	20
In the catacombs, I found myself in a theater of madness and a whirlwind of emotions. I was hunted by the infamous Spanish pirate hunter, Don Enrico de la Vega—known as Zorro. He was impeccably dressed, with a light yet sturdy breastplate hidden beneath his clothes. My officer and friend, Hercule Tonzag, foiled the nobleman's scheme. When Don Enrico saw Hercule, the seasoned bounty hunter nearly trembled with fear—a surprising sight that snapped me back to my senses. In the end, we turned the tables and hunted the hunter. Cornered, Don Enrico proved himself a skilled and dangerous, though dishonorable, adversary—yet he possessed a certain dignity. Together, we defeated this fox—though I’d sooner call him a snake. Even with Hercule’s help, it was no easy feat. Hercule led me through a secret passage he had discovered, as the way I entered was now blocked by rocks.

Now it's time to find my brother. I've decided to sever all ties with Terrax, as it brought me no closer to saving Michel, despite his promises. If I ever return to that path, it will be on my own terms—and only as Charles de Maure: proud, noble, and worthy, not some pawn of a prince. Farewell, Charlie. From here on, I go alone.
