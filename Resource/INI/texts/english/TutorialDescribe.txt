Key Layout_descr
{
The alternative layout includes a number of control changes, adds new commands, and opens up new possibilities:
~
- quick action commands and looting corpses have been changed
- the use of boosting potions has been changed
- character menu tabs are available on separate keys
}

OptKurs {Course Angle}
OptKurs_descr
{
Black arrows on the mini-map show the course at which your ship will move at maximum speed.
~
Some types of ships can sail almost against the wind, which is useful when you need to catch up with a merchant or escape from a warship.
~
The wind constantly changes its strength and direction. Try to adapt and adjust your course, finding a compromise between the optimal course angle and the direction to your goal.
}

SeaTimeScaleUp {Time Acceleration}
SeaTimeScaleUp_descr
{
Use acceleration — it saves time, especially at sea.
~
Controls: + and -

}

SeaFastTravel {Fast Travel}
SeaFastTravel_descr
{
The action menu opens up many useful functions both on land and at sea.
~
The 'Sail to' function allows you to instantly appear next to a friendly ship or geographic point. The range can be increased by using rarer and more expensive spyglasses.
~
Use the action menu to instantly reach the 'Ghost' and send a boat to it.

}

LandTimeScaleDown {Time Slowdown}
LandTimeScaleDown_descr
{
In difficult battles, it makes sense to use time slowdown. There is nothing wrong with this, since Caribbean Legend is a challenging game.
~
Controls: + and -

GuideFight {Land Battles}
GuideFight_descr
{
It will take you time to master battles in the game. If you have hints enabled, you will see hotkeys in the lower right corner of the screen.
~
First, try to master the 'Parry - Strike' combo. Successfully parrying an enemy's attack will stun them and make them lose energy, giving you a chance to attack safely.
~
Use different types of attacks to see which deals the most damage. Every weapon in the game has its preferred type of attack. Experiment!

OneToOneCave {Using Terrain}
OneToOneCave_descr
{
If you are outnumbered, try to use the environment to gain an advantage in battle.
~
You can almost always find a place where you can force the enemy to fight you one-on-one or two-on-one.
}

OneToOneBoarding {Using Terrain}
OneToOneBoarding_descr
{
If you are outnumbered, try to use the environment to gain an advantage in battle.
~
You can almost always find a place where you can force the enemy to fight you one-on-one or two-on-one.
}

Collision {Changing Position}
Collision_descr
{
Sometimes during battle, you need to change position by breaking through the enemy's formation or bypassing allies.
~
Your hero automatically pushes allies aside, and to break through enemy lines you need to use sprint or dodges.
In battle, sprint consumes energy, so use it wisely.
}

WorldMap {World Map}
WorldMap_descr
{
The world map allows you to make sea voyages across the game world. You don't have to sail exactly to every city or bay; just exit the world map in the target area and use the 'Sail to' function.
~
Skillful use of the 'Sail to' function can significantly reduce real travel time. For example, you can exit the world map on one side of the island, use fast travel to reach a bay on the other side, and then return to the world map from there.
~
Use hotkeys to zoom in on the map and open the atlas with maps.

LandMap {Land Navigation}
LandMap_descr
{
Traveling on land can be simplified by navigating using the island map. This is especially useful in quests, stealth infiltration into cities, and treasure hunting.
All available maps can be found in the Atlas.
Maps can be bought or found.
}

LandMap_controlsimg1 {MapView}

Navigator {Navigator}
Navigator_descr
{
Assign a navigator with a high navigation skill!
~
Navigation primarily determines what size ships a character can command.
~
For example, fifth rank requires 25 points, and fourth already 45. Violating this restriction will result in penalties to all character stats.
~
You can see the requirements for each rank by right-clicking the skill icon in the character window.
~
The Navigation skill grows slowly, so hire experienced navigators in taverns at the first opportunity. However, keep in mind that you won't be able to find a specialist with a skill level above 75.
}

Alchemy {Alchemy}
Alchemy_descr
{
Crafting items, especially talismans, potions, and ammunition, can make your life much easier. This is especially useful in boss battles.
~
To craft an item, you need to find or buy a recipe. You don't have to carry ingredients with you; you can safely buy all sorts of junk and store it in one of the chests in your cabin.
~
At the start of the game, you have a choice: take the Alchemy skill and start buying recipes, or postpone this opportunity until mid-game, when you have toolkits and it's no longer necessary to spend a valuable skill point on Alchemy.
}

Your quest objective is on the other side of the island. Exit the bay to the right and follow the shore!
}

Salary {Ship Maintenance}
Salary_descr
{
Payments to officers and crew are made every month and can significantly complicate the captain's life.
~
The final amount depends on the 'Trade' and 'Charisma' skills, ship rank, and difficulty level. Even on small vessels, it is highly desirable to have a purser officer on board, and a large warship can bankrupt even a country.
~
If you have the loot sharing option enabled, the payment amount can be even higher.

}

Dubloons {Doubloons}
Dubloons_descr
{
Gold doubloons are the true indicator of the main character's wealth and ability to solve problems with money. They are usually kept in small chests that can be opened using the crafting panel available from the action menu. You can also fill these chests if you have enough doubloons.
~
Always strive to earn these gold coins, as the most powerful people in the Caribbean archipelago offer their services exclusively for doubloons.
~
A good source of doubloons can be treasures, bank deposits, trading in strategic goods, and moneylenders.
~
You don't have to carry gold with you to use it — just put it in one of the chests in your cabin.

}

Dubloons_controlsimg1 {LICommandsActivate}

Box {Item Storage}
Box_descr
{
You can store an unlimited number of personal items in the captain's cabin chests.
~
Sell off excess, but always keep a supply of jewelry, weapons, ammunition, and alchemy ingredients in the cabin.
~
In addition to the required equipment in the outfit slots, it makes sense to carry only a set of potions, amulets, and shots for firearms with you.
~
Other captains also follow this practice, so it's always a good idea to loot the chests in the cabin of a captured ship.
}

Health {Health Drop}
Health_descr
{
Your 'Health' has dropped! This parameter describes the character's overall condition and affects all their stats.
~
'Health' drops from using primitive healing means, story situations, drinking, and overloading.
~
It is restored by special potions, love affairs, resting in a tavern, and simply over time. In especially severe cases, priests may help.
~
Unique officers also lose 'Health' if they are seriously wounded in battle. Fortunately, they recover it on their own.

}

Amulet {Amulets}
Amulet_descr
{
Amulets are powerful character boosters and are divided into offensive, defensive, and auxiliary. Note that you cannot equip an offensive and defensive amulet at the same time, so choose your sets wisely.
~
In addition to amulets, there are two more types of boosters: talismans and charms.
~
Talismans last longer than amulets and have more extensive effects, while charms possess great power, last indefinitely, and have a separate slot in the inventory.
~
Always keep several sets in your inventory — for passing especially difficult skill checks and tough battles at sea and on land.

}

Perk {Skill Points}
Perk_descr
{
You have just received your first skill point (SP)! They are the most important element of character development in the game and are divided into sea and personal.
~
Sea skills make you more dangerous at sea, and personal ones — on land and in communication with people.
~
Both types of SP develop independently as your personal and ship skills grow. On average, every 30 skill points in one group give one SP.
~
To quickly gain sea SP, it is recommended to complete ship contracts and charters. Personal SP grow faster if you constantly fight with different types of weapons and spend a lot of time in taverns.
~
Note that personal SP are much more valuable, as most sea skills can be covered by officers.

Fighter {Boarders}
Fighter_descr
{
Boarders are your most trusted officers, bodyguards, and vanguard. They will follow you into the thick of battle, and you will spend most of your time with them.
~
You can lead up to three fighters at a time. In addition to guarding the captain on land, the vanguard increases boarding efficiency and helps carry heavy treasures from hoards.
~
Unique officers, which you can only find through quests, stand apart. And although not every such character can be an effective boarder, they all have a great influence on the game's plot and cannot die in ordinary combat.
~
Don't forget to equip your people with amulets, healing items, weapons, and ammunition. You can exchange items either through the action menu or through any chest.
~
You can order boarders to hold position, follow the hero, or attack using hotkeys or in dialogue.

Rest {Time of Day Change}
Rest_descr
{
The time of day change function is available!
~
Everything in the game is subject to time: at night, guards do not stand on the pier and at city gates, you can only hire a crew in taverns during the day, and some characters are very particular about the time of day, especially when you work for them.
~
Feel free to use this function at sea and in the wild, but in cities try to spend the night in a tavern.

Rest_controlsimg1{BICommandsActivate}

Navigation{Ship Control}
Navigation_descr
{
Welcome to the Caribbean Sea!
Ship control is a complex science, but with practice, you will master this art perfectly.
~
Use the turn keys to control the ship's course. The ship is a heavy object with great inertia and turns slowly, so plan maneuvers in advance.
~
Sail and speed control is carried out using the sail mode switch keys.
There are 3 sail modes: full, battle, and lowered. At full sails, the ship reaches maximum speed, battle sails make the ship more maneuverable, and lowered sails bring the ship to a smooth stop.
~
In a storm and during enemy salvos, sails should be fully lowered; during turns and aiming — set to battle mode, and for chasing the enemy, nothing is better than full sails.
Over time, you will learn to handle the sails like a true sea wolf, but until then, you can follow these simple tips.
~
Try different sail modes and turns, feel the ship's inertia, and enjoy the beautiful sunset! And to move on, press the "deck" button.

Stealth{Stealth}
Stealth_descr
{
You will have to get used to the idea that you are not welcome in most settlements of the Caribbean archipelago.
~
You can infiltrate an enemy city in two ways: through the port or the gates.
~
Safe docking in a hostile port will require serious preparation. You will need to raise the flag of a country not hostile to that port and have a sufficiently high Stealth skill.
~
It is better to infiltrate through the city gates at night, while they are not guarded. Avoid soldiers and spend the night in a tavern. In case of alarm, find a house and wait there for a couple of hours. The advantage of this method is that you do not need to spend a valuable sea skill point to unlock flags.
~
All these problems can be avoided by buying a trading company license in Curaçao and still spending a sea skill point on one of the neutral flags.
}

SeaBattle{Sea Battle}
SeaBattle_descr
{
Welcome to sea battle, captain!
Your main task is to survive and sink enemy ships.
~
Each ship has 3 main characteristics — hull, sails, and crew. If the hull reaches zero, the ship sinks; sail damage imposes speed penalties, and crew reduction makes boarding easier and slows down all ship processes.
~
For effective damage to each of these characteristics, there are special types of ammunition. Grapeshot — for the crew, chain shot — for sails and masts, and bombs — for the hull. Cannonballs are universal ammunition with the greatest range. The damage dealt depends not only on the type of ammunition but also on the gun used. Usually, the larger the gun, the more damage it deals.
~
There are 2 main firing modes. Quick salvo is available if the enemy ship is in the firing sector. It is not very accurate and effective in the early stages of the game but allows for dynamic combat. Aimed salvo is activated with the aiming button and allows for very accurate fire from the broadside. You need to get used to this mode, but it is worth it.
~
Try not to expose yourself to enemy fire and first destroy sails and masts — this will make your opponents much less dangerous.
~
Each ship, depending on its rigging, has an optimal course relative to the wind, at which it reaches maximum speed. This course is indicated by black arrows on the compass. Skillful use of your ship's strengths is the key to success in sea battle.
~
In the romantic imagination of Charles De Mora, your captain is experienced, and the enemies are weak. Try different firing modes and learn maneuvers during battle — this will come in handy in the dangerous waters of the Caribbean. And if the battle seems too slow, you can speed it up using the time control keys.

BoardingTactics{Boarding}
BoardingTactics_descr
{
Before boarding, you need to make at least a couple of grapeshot salvos to weaken the enemy crew without receiving a symmetrical response. Once you have the advantage in manpower, approach the enemy ship as close as possible, match its speed, and rush into battle!
~
The higher the sea skill 'Boarding', the easier it will be for you to successfully grapple with the enemy ship.
~
Boarding efficiency depends on the number, skills, and morale of your crew. Having an experienced boatswain, boarders, amulets, and developed combat skills in the captain can offset the enemy's numerical advantage.
}

Mushket{Muskets}
Mushket_descr
{
Long-barreled firearms are extremely dangerous in battle. Only the main character with the 'Musketeer' skill unlocked, as well as some unique officers, can use them. The most striking example of such an officer is Tichingitu, and it is to him that you should give your first musket.
~
Unlike melee weapons, any firearm is highly flexible — by developing your character as a shooter, equipping certain amulets and gear, and using different types of ammunition, you can turn the tide of any battle.

Welcome aboard the "Ulysses"! Caribbean Legend is a challenging game, so we've prepared a small starter adventure for you on this ship.
~
By completing it, you will master all the necessary skills and understand the game mechanics.
~
Controls in the game are carried out using movement keys and the mouse. Your character can walk and run in all directions, as well as use sprint to accelerate.
You will also often need the action menu — it has many useful features, but at this stage of the game its capabilities are limited.  
~
You can freely look around with the mouse — this allows you to find hidden items, keep the battle under control, and simply enjoy the sights. 
~
There are many interesting activities aboard the "Ulysses": you can explore the ship, talk to the crew, complete quests, and even gather starting capital. When you feel ready to move on, select the "Finish business" line in the dialogue with the captain.

Thank you for playing, and see you at sea!

You can aim with any firearm to shoot more accurately. Hold the aim button to enter this mode. Release the button to exit without firing. 
~
Shooting in aiming mode is more accurate and deadly, but the price is reduced visibility and movement speed.
~
The longer you aim, the more damage you deal. If you shoot in the head, the damage will be even higher. If you take damage, the aim will reset, and the character will stagger.
}

Overload {Overload}

Overload_descr
{
You have encountered carrying weight limits for the first time. 
Each character in the game has a limited maximum carrying weight, and its limit depends on strength, perks, and amulets.
Each item also has its own weight, and even the lightest of them in large quantities can lead to overload, which in turn results in penalties to stats and skills.
Try to find something that increases your character's maximum carrying weight — for example, from a merchant. 
}

Logbook {Logbook and Documents}

Logbook_descr
{
Every quest you take is recorded in the Logbook. It is very important to carefully read dialogues and Logbook entries — they often contain important clarifications and instructions for further actions.
In addition to quests, the Logbook contains other important information: in the Documents section, you can read all the notes you have found, and sections like Trade and the Cash Book will be useful to you much later.
Try to familiarize yourself with the Logbook entries by pressing F3.
~
And remember — Caribbean Legend is a challenging game, and the depth of some quests may not be obvious. Don't hesitate to ask for advice in Discord — you will definitely get help and tips. 
}

DeadSearch {Looting Corpses}

DeadSearch_descr
{
After any battle, as in any good role-playing game, it's time to collect trophies.
Any fallen enemy can be looted by pressing 1 near their body, but not all of them will have something valuable in their pockets.
~
If the bodies are too close and get in each other's way, you can press the "Do not loot" button in the loot menu — this will permanently forbid looting that particular body.
~
These guys probably have at least one healing elixir in their pockets, which Alonso needs so much.
}

Trading {Trade and Pricing Basics}

Trading_descr
{
Trade is a deep and complex system where many factors affect the purchase and sale price.
~
In land trade, the player's Trade skill and background are primarily evaluated.
~
In sea trade, there are more factors — in addition to the above, the price depends on the type of goods, their origin, the size of the colony, export and import routes, as well as the skills and perks of the Purser.
~
Sooner or later you will figure it all out, but for now, it's worth buying some useful Trade amulet.
