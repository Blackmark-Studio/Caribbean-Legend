Have you heard? Some whore without documents was caught in our port. They say she escaped from a brothel after cleaning out the chests of the owner there. This carrier of infection and theft should have been shut down long ago. After all, our children see all this, what can they learn?

Oh-oh-oh, captain, I heard you had a lot of fun recently.... You, my friend, are now a poor man! Ha-ha-ha!!

GenQuests_41
{
Have you heard, @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>, that the patrol captain @<sShipType> @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name>. was recently arrested. It turns out he was moonlighting as a smuggler. Just think, before What has the current governor brought to the colony! Those who are supposed to catch pirates are robbing us themselves!.. Rumor has it that in a week he will be executed. That serves him right.
}

GenQuests_42
{
Rumor has it that the patrol captain @<sShipType> @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name>  turned out to be the organizer of a gang of smugglers. He was caught and will soon be hanged. It looks like @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>, our governor has taken the lead seriously order in the colony.
}

GenQuests_43
{
Can you imagine? The commander of the fort exposed a secret organization of smugglers, which managed to recruit even naval officers into its ranks. One of them, whose name is @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name>, has already been caught and will soon be hanged. Oh, @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>, I always said that our governor will sooner or later restore order in the settlement.
}

GenQuests_44
{
Do you already know that the captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name> was arrested? The authorities learned that he hid a large consignment of goods, which he confiscated from ships passing in the waters. It seems that he will not be hanged avoid. But, I'll tell you, he was one of the best in the patrol squadron. Who would have thought...
}

GenQuests_45

Damn! The prisoner escaped!
}

GenQuests_46
{
Have you heard, @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>, that a patrol captain was recently hanged @<sShipType> @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name>. They say he robbed some merchant. Here after all, as it happens, you can't trust anyone... And the whole team with him was executed together. Collusion means...
}

GenQuests_47
{
Do you already know, @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>, that the former patrol captain @<sShipType> @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name> was executed? Rumor has it that he sank some important ship, and hid the goods. And none of the team admitted where the hiding place was. So they all were hanged...
}

GenQuests_48
{
Can you imagine, @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>? One of the captains of the patrol squadron was engaged in sea robbery. So he was recently executed along with his entire crew. They say that they robbed and sank merchant ships.
}

GenQuests_49

They recently executed a former captain named @<pchar.GenQuest.CaptainComission.Name> along with the team of his patrol @<sShipType>.. Rumor has it that they hid a large consignment of goods that were confiscated from ships passing in the waters. But this was one of the best patrol crews. I think, @<GetAddress_Form(pchar)>, that they were deliberately slandered. After all, the goods were never found..

Вы знаете, капитан @<GetFullName(pchar)> спас девушку по имени @<pchar.GenQuest.EncGirl.name> от насильников в джунглях... А-а, так это же вы!! Я вами восхищаюсь...

Девушке по имени @<pchar.GenQuest.EncGirl.name> здорово повезло - недавно на неё напали бандиты в джунглях, хотели изнасиловать, видать. Но ничего у них не вышло, хе-хе, и благодарить она должна капитана @<GetMainCharacterNameGen()>!

GenQuests_103

Well, captain @<GetFullName(pchar)>, nobody could ever think that you would leave a helpless woman in the hands of bandits to be their plaything. Poor @<pchar.GenQuest.EncGirl.name>, if only I had words...
