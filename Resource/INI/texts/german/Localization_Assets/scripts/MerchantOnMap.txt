People say that the daring pirate - @<GetFullName(pchar)> began to rob @<NationNameSK(sti(MerPrm.ination))> trader ships. And then our Governor General decided to put an end to him. He equipped a ship disguised as a merchant with several dozen well-trained soldiers from Europe and sent it to him. But the bloodthirsty pirate killed them all and again eluded justice!
