Have you heard the news? The rivados sorcerer, old Chimiset, was hacked to death in prison in his cage. They say it was done by the Admiral's men. Black Eddie is just furious...
}

Saga_23

The sorcerer Rivados, Chimiset, was killed. Oddly enough, they suspect not the narwhals, but the people of the Shark. The Rivados are very angry with the admiral ...
}

Saga_24

The admiral's prison is turning into a murder scene: first Alan Milrow, now Chimiset. Yes, the admiral cracks down hard on his opponents.

Yeah, we didn't go greedy on gunpowder there! Boomed so loud that they have probably heard it even at Tortuga. The frigate got her powder supplies detonated and her captain went to the bottom along with his ship in no time.

}

Saga_101
{
They have murdered a head of Narwals right in the prison. Creepy act, I'll tell ya. To kill a helpless man just like that...
}

Saga_102
{
Hear, hear! Alan got into the admiral's prison, spent a few months in a cage for and then was killed without any trial. And our eccentric Red Mary is completely lost in her cabin of 'Ceres Smithy'. Poor girl, crying every night. Used to be such a joyful bird!

Do you know where is Adolf Barbier? He had disappeared right after he got money and a new cabin...
}

Saga_107
{
Odd things happen here. This madcap Red Mary had disappeared along with Chad Kapper. I am confident that it was Rivados' doing. They avenged their wizard...
}

Saga_108
{
Now it is Red May lost. Likely dead, that is what happens when you screw with Rivados. I am sure that they are responsible for Chad's and Mary's disappearance.
}

Saga_109
{
They say that odd noises were coming from 'Caroline' last night, someone was fighting there and they heard a woman's pre-death cry. I believe that this explains the disappearance of May Casper. Poor girl! I am sure, that we shall never see her again...
